In March, an unexpected email from the [New York Road Runners](http://nyrr.org)
landed in my inbox with the subject line: “Claim Your Entry to Run on November
2!”

I was confused. I had already used all my 9+1 guaranteed entry slots from my
time living in New York (2019, 2022, 2024). Assuming it was a system error, I
waited for a correction email.

It never arrived. I texted a friend, who pointed out that the guaranteed entry
standard for males 40-44 is 2:58. I had qualified with two minutes to spare
based on my 2024 NYC Marathon time! Despite my continual ranting about the
logistical overhead of the NYC start line—and swearing off the race forever—I
couldn't resist. I deferred my Chicago entry and decided to run New York
instead.

These are my notes on preparation and execution (written, as usual, to remind
my future self of the experience).

## Training

With my second daughter due a month after the [2024 New York City
Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/12815303054), I knew my free time
was running out. I decided to cross one last-minute item off my bucket list:
Boulder’s iconic [Skyline
Traverse](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/boulder-skyline-traverse-co)—a
17.3mi route with 5,846ft of gain summiting three local peaks. I was led by
three running partners, all of whom have way more trail experience I do. It was
a fantastic day of [type-2 fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale).
However, I twisted my ankle twice near the end, an injury I would have to nurse
throughout training in 2025.

After Reina was born in December 2024, I intentionally took time off until
mid-March. I harbored some ambition to train for the [BOLDERBoulder
10k](https://www.bolderboulder.com/) on Memorial Day, but my training was
sporadic, haphazard, and unfocused, and relied entirely on easy endurance paces.
The race was a wake-up call; the result made it painfully obvious how much
fitness I had lost during my hiatus.

{{< img peanut.jpg "I was happy to have found the NUTMobile during a run!" >}}

That poor result inspired a return to serious training. I started the [McMillan
hill training
plan](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/plans-details/hill-module-level-5/) in
June, coinciding with the start of three months of paternity leave. While I hoped to run
high volume during this break, childrearing and house projects kept me between
60-70 miles/week, albeit with good consistency with hill repeats and long runs.

The fitness returned. toward the end of the hill block in July, I [ran a
standard route](https://www.strava.com/activities/15154561774) featuring a
1,200ft climb. I felt sharp, setting multiple uphill segment PRs and not
stopping once.

Proper marathon training began in mid-August. With the release of the 4th
Edition of [Pete Pfitzinger’s *Advanced
Marathoning*](https://us.humankinetics.com/products/advanced-marathoning-4th-edition),
I decided to use a hybrid of the 12/55-70 and 12/70-85 plans. My goal was
flexibility with consistency: being present for my family while adhering to the
schedule as closely as possible.

I didn't quite hit my desired volume: only five weeks topped 70 miles. But I
did comfortably hit 80 miles for the first time ever during a peak week.

**Key Adjustments:**
1.  **Easier Recovery:** I slowed my recovery runs significantly (9:00/mi vs. 6:35/mi MP) and moved them to a flat treadmill. This left me feeling much fresher for key workouts.
2.  **No Doubles:** I focused my extra time on house renovations rather than second daily runs.

Despite worrying about the lack of speed work in the Pfitz plan, I trusted the
process. My tune-up race, the Boulderthon Half Marathon in September, went
well. By October, I was routinely running at the front of my club’s long runs.

Then, the traditional self-inflicted taper injury struck. I bashed my kneecap
against the steering tube of my [cargo
bike](https://urbanarrow.com/family-bikes/family) during a moving dismount gone
wrong. After one unplanned rest day, the pain subsided, and I was ready for New
York.

## Pre-Race

I followed the same template as last year.

**Friday:** Arrived in NYC and headed straight to
[Tonchin](https://www.tonchinus.com/hoursandlocations-midtown) for
Michelin-recognized ramen. I skipped the spicy tan tan for a race-safe tonkotsu
and banana pudding.

**Saturday Morning:**
* Met the Boulder Track Club for a run up 6th Avenue to watch the pros in the [Dash to the Finish 5k](https://events.nyrr.org/abbott-dash-to-the-finish-line-5k).
* Visited [Zucker's Bagels](https://www.zuckersbagels.com/) to stock up on carbs.
* Hit the expo for a rapid bib pickup.

{{< img "abbot-5k.jpg" "The pro women's race flies up an empty Sixth Avenue." >}}

**Saturday Afternoon:**
* Spent too much time on my feet buying souvenirs at the [Lego Store](https://www.lego.com/en-us/stores/store/5th-avenue).
* Ordered pancakes from [Clinton Street Baking Co](https://www.clintonstreetbaking.com/) and pasta for dinner.
* Watched running YouTube videos with my feet up.

## Race Morning

I am continually in awe of the logistics required to move 60,000+ people to Staten Island. That said, I got bit by my own assumptions.

Last year, I arrived at Bryant Park at 5:30am, breezed onto a bus, and spent hours freezing at Fort Wadsworth. This year, I figured I could leave later to minimize the wait. I grabbed Starbucks at 5:30am and walked to the library, only to find a line snaking completely around the block.

That line took forever. Once I finally boarded a bus, I dozed off, waking up to a standstill on the Verrazzano Bridge. We sat there for an eternity. When I finally disembarked, the security lines were the longest I’d ever seen. As I joined the queue, workers barricaded the entrance behind me. I was on one of the last buses.

The line barely moved. Volunteers frantically pulled Wave 1 runners forward, but the corrals were set to close strictly at 8:45am. I stashed my phone in my bag, cleared the metal detector, and sprinted toward the blue corrals.

I had complained about the lack of warm-up space in the past; I solved that problem by sprinting at sub-marathon pace through the start village.

{{< img startvillage.png "I got a decent impromptu warmup through the start village." >}}

I arrived to see the blue-bibbed runners already walking out. Between me and them were locked crowd-control gates.

I ran to the first opening. A volunteer shouted, “The gates are closed! Wave 2 is a perfectly good wave!”

I sprinted to the next gate. "My bus was late! Can I—"

"Corrals closed ten minutes ago!" the security guard bellowed. He saw the panic in my eyes. "But come on. Come through here."

He slid the gate open. "You can’t bring the bag, though."

I tossed my bag toward a trash can and stepped through.

Then it hit me: **my phone was still in the bag.**

*Fuck.*

I turned back, rummaged through the trash can, and couldn't find it.

“Come on, man! They’re leaving!” the guard yelled.

I dumped the bag out, finally located the phone, and ran back through the gate. I gripped the guard's shoulder, gave him the most heartfelt thank you of my life, and ran.

Adrenaline pumping, I stripped off my donation layers, used a porta-potty, and merged into the crowd just as we approached the bridge. I was surrounded by Corral C runners—exactly where I was supposed to be.

I owe my entire race to that security guard.

{{< img start.jpg "So many people between me and the start line." >}}

## The Race

Due to the [AbbottWMM Age Group World Championships](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/rankings/world-championships) and the general [running boom](https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/track-field/marathon-interest-boom-races-abbott-majors-world-rcna233298), I started one corral further back than last year. It felt like I was buried deep in the pack, though the data shows I crossed the start line only a minute later than I did in 2024.

I had worried about pacing the uphill first mile, but those worries were unfounded; the bridge was packed. My pace was dictated by slow runners and, unbelievably, people texting on their phones.

Things loosened up in Brooklyn. I bumped into my friend Howon, chatted briefly, and then settled into a rhythm. My focus was on maintaining a relaxed composure and pushing slightly whenever I felt good.

In Williamsburg (Mile 11), I caught the [2:55 pacers](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/46782088/nyc-marathon-secret-life-pacers). One of them was Justin, a friend from my track club. As we climbed the Queensboro Bridge, I could hear him coaching his group. I told myself, “I gotta get away from this guy!” and surged over the crest to fly down into Manhattan.

{{< img queensboro.jpg "Coming over the Queensboro Bridge with the 2:55 pacers behind me." >}}
{{< img pacer.png "The time gap between me and the 2:55 pacers." >}}

On First Avenue, for the second year in a row, I passed [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat). I wouldn't have noticed him if the crowd hadn't started screaming "Casey! Casey!" I turned my head, and there he was.

Physically, I battled tight calves early on and a sharp hip pain at Mile 18 that scared me, but I ran through it, and it faded.

The climb up Fifth Avenue felt strong. It felt like I was passing hundreds of runners (though the stats say I only passed a net 168 runners over the final miles). Entering Central Park was a psychological relief. I focused on form, crossed the line in 2:52:33, and took a moment to be grateful for a healthy cycle.

Then I looked to my left and saw three dudes vomiting in unison. Nature is healing.

{{< img floberg.jpg "I also bumped into Eric Floberg after the finish. He published [a touching video about this race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bamn10UTOKk)." >}}

I was remarkably consistent, especially considering the difficult course profile.

| Distance | Split | 5k Time | Difference | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 km** | 0:20:43 | 20:43 | | Warm-up / Verrazzano |
| **10 km** | 0:40:52 | 20:09 | -34s | |
| **15 km** | 1:01:14 | 20:22 | +13s | |
| **20 km** | 1:21:31 | 20:17 | -5s | |
| **Half** | 1:26:01 | | | |
| **25 km** | 1:42:01 | 20:30 | +13s | |
| **30 km** | 2:02:02 | 20:01 | -29s | Fastest 5km |
| **35 km** | 2:22:32 | 20:30 | +29s | |
| **40 km** | 2:43:30 | 20:58 | +28s | |
| **Finish** | 2:52:33 | | | +32s positive split |

In his book *[The Running Ground](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678434/the-running-ground-by-nicholas-thompson/)*, Nicholas Thompson notes that a marathoner spends about half their time in the air. Indeed, I spent 44.7% of the race flying:

$$
\frac{\text{2h52m33s} - (\frac{\text{42.2km}}{\text{1.37m stride}} \times \text{193ms contact time})}{\text{2h52m33s}} = \text{44.7\% time in air}
$$

## Post-Race

I continued my tradition of post-race dining with friends, this time at [Moody Tongue Pizza](https://www.moodytongue.com/location/moody-tongue-pizza/). We had the back room to ourselves, followed by beers at [Augurs Well Bar](https://www.augurswellbar.com/) where we celebrated with other finishers.

I capped the night cheering for the final runners at the finish line and grabbing a [Kati Roll](https://www.thekatirollcompany.com/). The next morning, fueled by [Los Tacos No. 1](https://www.lostacos1.com/) breakfast burritos and Blue Bottle coffee, I headed back to Boulder, already thinking about the next one.
