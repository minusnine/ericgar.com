Veracity in science fiction:

<blockquote>Look at me. Look at me! When you make love to me Gaius, you don't always think about me. Your mind wanders, I know that. You think of equations, puzzles... your laundry. it's the nature of the mind to disconnect from the body and journey on its own .</blockquote>

- Six to Dr. Gaius Baltar, Battlestar Galactica
