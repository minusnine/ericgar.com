This from <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?ppds=bylL&amp;v1=RANDY%20COHEN&amp;fdq=19960101&amp;td=sysdate&amp;sort=newest&amp;ac=RANDY%20COHEN&amp;inline=nyt-per">Randy Cohen</a>, the New York Times Ethicist,  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10wwln-ethicist-t.html">on a castle that charges more to foreigners</a>:

<blockquote>If this sort of transparency leads to complaints so be it. Castle managers should be prepared to explain their prices (<strong>or to pour boiling oil from the battlements onto vistitors who besiege them with complaints</strong>).</blockquote>
