Earlier this week, [Amazon terminated] the Amazon Web Services
account that WikiLeaks was using to host the site, possibly [caving
to political pressure][pressure] from the office of Senator Joe
Lieberman. Lieberman subsequently issued a statement calling for
[all companies to censor WikiLeaks][statement]. Daniel Ellsberg, the
figurehead behind the [Pentagon Papers], [published an open letter to
Amazon condemning this decision][letter], closed his Amazon account,
and encouraged others to do the same.

Glenn Greenwald has an excellent piece on how [Joe Lieberman Emulates
Chinese Dictators][grr].

I just requested that my account be cancelled. *[You can too][close]*. I
used to use Amazon as a convenient one-stop shop for pretty much
everything, so yes, my life will get a little bit more inconvenient
without said account.

Thomas Jefferson, 1791:

> I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much
> liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.
