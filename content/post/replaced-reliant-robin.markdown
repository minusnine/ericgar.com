A few weekends ago, I was poking around my site statistics and found
that I had a huge number of hits and was using a much larger percentage
of my bandwidth than I'd expect with a silly, personal text- and
image-only weblog:

<img src="/uploads/2010/12/weekly_report.jpg" style="width: 85%" class="post_image" alt="weekly hit report for ericgar.com" />

So I took a look at my referrers:

And sure enough someone is [hotlinking one of my images][hot] at
http://forums.vwvortex.com. It turns out it's my from my post about
[Buying a Reliant Robin]\:

<img src="/uploads/2010/12/referrer_page.jpg" style="width: 65%" class="post_image" alt="forum post for ugliest car" />

Which they found because I'm the first hit in Google Image Search for
"Reliant Robin":

<img src="/uploads/2010/12/google.jpg" style="width: 85%" class="post_image" alt="google image for reliant robin" />

So I replaced it with this:
