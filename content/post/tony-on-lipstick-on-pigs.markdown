My old friend Tony has it right <a href="http://tonguebutnodoor.net/?p=181">when he says</a>:

<blockquote>
Some commentators have suggested he straightforwardly implied that Palin was a pig. Which would be insulting, but doesn't sound sexist to me. A more subtle (although more sensible) jab would be the following implied argument:

   1. A pig with lipstick is still a pig
   2. Palin (according to her acceptance speech) is a pitbull with lipstick
   3. Palin is still a pitbull

That's arguably unfavorable, except that Palin made the comparison herself.
