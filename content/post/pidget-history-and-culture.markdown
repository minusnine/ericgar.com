<span><a href="http://somudro.info">Somudro</a> links to two extremely well written articles about the lost culture of pidgets, <a href="http://somudro.info/Sexual%20Culture.pdf">"A Review of Pidget Sexual Culture"</a> and <a href="http://somudro.info/History.pdf">"Pidgets: A Historical Overview"</a> (both PDFs). Well worth the read.</span>

<span>From <a href="http://somudro.info">somudro.info</a>:</span>

<blockquote>Anthropologists believe that in ancient Africa the most common form of currency was the "pidget." Pidgets were in fact an enslaved race of short and stout people, resembling a cross between pygmies and malformed midgets... But how did such a cruel societal modus operandi arise? Was it effective as an economic system? And what was life like for a member of this noble yet ill-fated race? These questions will be examined in the series of articles that follow.</blockquote>
