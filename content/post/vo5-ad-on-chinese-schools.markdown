I was just watching Letterman when this advertisement came on the tele:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WGoLgIClXtc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WGoLgIClXtc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

I hope people don't really think this is what Chinese schools are like. The girl is cute though.

<span><strong>Edit</strong>: Yes, it's supposed to be China and not North Korea. The characters are Chinese and the map on the wall is of China.</span>
