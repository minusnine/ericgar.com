In Physics Lab, a 200-person lecture, on Tuesday:



<blockquote><em><strong>Professor</strong></em>: If someone came to me and said that there is an invisible dragon in my garage, what can i do to prove it doesn't exist?
<em><strong>Student</strong></em>: You can have a knight in shining armor enter the garage and the dragon by its very nature will be forced to fight it.
</blockquote>
