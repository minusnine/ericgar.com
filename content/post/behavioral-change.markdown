Precisely. People will adapt to this stimulus. They **will
change**. That's why high prices of oil are good for exactly
one reason: it encourages positive behavioral change toward
efficiency.[^1]

[^1]: Granted, the fact that it may mean less food for some families
suck. This is a consequence and a testimony to the power of economics
and proper planning, at both the macro- and microeconomic scale.
