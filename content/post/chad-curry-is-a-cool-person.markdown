From this week's "<a href="http://nymag.com/nymag/strategist/look/archive/">The Look Book</a>" in <a href="http://nymag.com/">New York Magazine</a> (yes, again):

<blockquote>
<strong>What do you do?</strong>
I knew you were going to ask that, but I'm weird about being associated with what I do. <em>We all label people based on that, so what I do is, I'm a human living life, just like you are.</em>

<strong>But how do you pay rent?</strong>
Vocationally, I'm a fashion stylist and an artist and I'm multifaceted. And then I also work at Jeffrey in their women's designer section. <em>I'm in a space with four walls and other people, and it's been very challenging to wrap my brain around that.</em>
</blockquote>

(Emphasis mine).

I've been thinking along similar lines. Pretty sweet.
