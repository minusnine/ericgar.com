Emphasis mine.

From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/jobs/23boss.html">an interview with Marc Ecko</a>:

> Whatever you do in life, be <strong>passionate</strong> about
> it. <em>At least</em> once a month, if not every day, reassess what
> you're doing and make sure you still love it. If you're passionate
> about something others around you may see as a dead end, <strong>pave
> your own way</strong>. Be a trailblazer.

From "<a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/technology/23digi.html">Why
Old Technologies Are Still Kicking</a>," a discussion on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>
technology:

> "Technologies <em>want</em> to survive, and they reinvent themselves
> to go on," he said.

From the opinion piece "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/opinion/23rich.html">The Republican Resurrection</a>" by Frank Rich:

> Mrs. Clinton is fond of mocking her adversary for offering "<em>just
> words</em>." But words can matter, and Mrs. Clinton's tragedy is that
> she never realized they could have mattered for her, too. You have
> to wonder if her Iraq speech would have been greeted with the same
> shrug<strong> if she had tossed away her usual talking points</strong>
> and seized the opportunity to address the war in <strong>the same
> adult way</strong> that Mr. Obama addressed race.
