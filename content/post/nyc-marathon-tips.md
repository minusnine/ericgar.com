Here are some New York City Marathon tips aimed at a first-timer marathoner,
though some of these tips would be useful even for an experienced marathoner
running NYC for the first time.

## A Year Before The Race

*   Ride your bike along the course before the race starts. A bunch of
    different cycling groups organize an event (for example, the [New York
    Cycling Club](https://nycc.org/node/111690) has a ride every year), but you
    can just go alone instead. The purpose of this scouting ride is to be able
    to visualize the course all throughout the training. In particular, you’ll
    know about the Queensboro Bridge, just how dang far it is to the Bronx from
    Brooklyn, what it means to get to Marcus Garvey Park, and the gentle giant
    slope that is 5th Avenue.

## Registration

*   Register for the latest bus or ferry possible. Use the extra time for
    sleep. Getting on an earlier bus just means more time spent waiting outside
    in the cold before the race.  
*   Consider registering for a bag at bag check even if you don’t use it. But,
    if the weather conditions are perfect, then most people will have no reason
      to check a bag. If the weather is sour, you might want some extra warmth
      waiting for you shortly after the race.
*   Register for a post-race poncho. If it is cold or raining, this will be a
    huge help, especially if you aren’t checking a bag. (The downside is that I
    have no idea when I’ll use an arm-less, thick, bright blue poncho. My
    training partner brought his from the prior year to the start of this
    year's race).

## The weeks before the race

*   If you haven’t already, or maybe even if you have, read _[A Race Like No
    Other by Liz
    Robbins](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061981968/a-race-like-no-other)_.
    This New York Times reporter gives a mile-by-mile accounting of the history
    of the race,  combined with vignettes of some personalities and
    neighborhoods involved in the 2007 race. This will provide some good
    motivation for your last few weeks of training.
*   If you live in the city, be sure to get some experience running over the
    Pulaski Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge. [My standard 13.2-mile training
    route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/27999458) features both of these, so
    I was well prepared.
*   Experiment with gels and hydration. On the course, they give out [Honey
    Stinger
    gels](https://www.honeystinger.com/products/energy-gels/organic-energy-gels)
    (definitely in vanilla, and maybe in some other flavors too), but not
    frequently enough for all of your caloric needs
    *    I use the [espresso-flavored Gu
         gels](https://guenergy.com/products/energy-gel?variant=31169147699251)
         with caffeine (since I really like coffee, these are actually a
         treat!) and the [Maurten 100
         gels](https://www.maurten.com/products/gel-100-box-us) (which have a
         higher water content and don’t coat your mouth like other gels). I
         take one every 45 minutes, but I’m now considering using more gels
         (say, every 30 minutes), switching over to Maurten exclusively, and
         drinking just plain water instead of Gatorade on the course.
*   Think about what specifically you will wear on race day. Do your long runs
    in exactly this outfit. Figure out where chafing occurs and either find a
    new piece of clothing, use medical tape to cover the area (protect the
    nipples!), or use an anti-chafing balm. Don’t wear anything — or do
    anything — new on race day.


## The week of the race



*   Don’t run too much the days leading up to the race (keep the _intensity_
    high but the _distance_ low). But if you do run, especially the day before
    the race as a shakeout, I highly recommend running the 2.2 miles of [the
    course that is inside of Central
    Park](https://scblob.nyrr.org/nyrrsitecoreblob/nyrr/pdf/race-course-maps/tcsnycm19_map_course_092419.pdf).
    Start at [Engineer’s
    Gate](http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/named-gates.html)
    at 90th Street & 5th Avenue and run south on East Drive. During the actual
    race, you’ll exit the park to run on 59th Street, but ignore this today.
    Staying on the park drive is good enough. Run all the way to the finish
    line, as close as you can get. Stop your run, turn around, and visualize
    what it will be like to be tired and sore running up this last hill.
    *   The predominant direction of running flow along the park’s loop is
        counter-clockwise. I don’t know why; I think it is because that is the
        direction car traffic flowed when private cars were allowed in the
        park. From now on, I’m going to favor running clockwise so that I get
        more practice on this critical part of the race.
*   Try to visit the Expo to pick up your bib on Friday to avoid having to be
    on your feet for a lot of Saturday.

## The day before the race

*   If you are meeting up with other runners, arrange a specific place and time
    to meet _before_ getting on the bus. Trying to find people at the start
    village can be harrying: cell phone service can be spotty and there are a
    lot of things going on in a small space.
    *   If you’re taking the bus from the New York Public Library. Pick a
        meeting place that isn’t too close to the library itself. My friend and
        I met up on the southwest corner of 42nd & 6th, which was a decent
        choice, but by 5:45am there were already a lot of people waiting at
        that specific corner.
*   Very clearly identify where your spectators will be located: be specific in
    the side of the street and where along the block. A good choice for
    Manhattanites is along the northern part of 1st Avenue. The crowd is most
    dense just after entering Manhattan but thins out starting around 100th
    street, so north of there gives good chances. Then, your spectators can
    migrate over to 5th Avenue in time to see you before you enter the park.
*   Review the course map and the elevation profile. Make note of the five
    bridges along the course and the hills just before the finish. Remember
    that even small gradients will be discouraging the later they appear in the
    race. I think the Queensboro Bridge is far harder than the Verrazano
    despite being less steep and shorter, just by virtue of being later in the
    race.
*   Come up with a pacing strategy. Write it down. Consider even writing it on
    your arm right next to your wrist with a sharpie: this will remind you
    every time you of your goal look at your watch. It is very easy to go out
    too fast.
*   As usual, get everything you will be bringing with you ready to reduce the
    chance of error. Put your bib on your shirt, gels in your pockets,
    sunglasses in your bag, and socks in your shoes, and arrange whatever else
    you need to be in pockets or as nearby as possible. Charge your watch.
*   I chose to make some peanut butter and banana sandwiches, which are a
    mainstay of my pre-race breakfast, and stashed them in a ziplock bag in the
    refrigerator, to be eaten closer to the start of the race, on the bus or in
    the corral.
*   Go to sleep early. Don’t be nervous: there is nothing to be nervous about.
    Your months of training have gotten you prepared. Seriously try to get 7+
    hours of sleep, which probably means you will need to be asleep by 10pm.

## Race Morning

*   If you’re taking the bus, don’t worry too much about being at the New York
    Public Library exactly on time. No one checks the bus time listed on your
    bib, so just get on whatever bus whenever you can. Don’t be a jerk, though:
    try your best to arrive on time. Definitely don’t arrive too late, but also
    definitely don’t arrive early. As I wrote earlier, you’re just going to
    wait outside in the cold if you get to Staten Island too early.
*   Don’t worry too much about exactly when you enter your designated corral.
    The corrals are pretty small (about the same size as a normal NYRR race)
    and there are a large number of porta potties in each one. In our corral,
    the bathroom line closest to the direction of ultimate travel (i.e. _away_
    from the bridge) was the shortest, but it was also the most confusing since
    people were just standing around in that area, eagerly waiting for the race
    to start.
*   Don’t wear anything you haven’t worn on a long run before. For example,
    race day morning was a bit chillier than I was expecting, so I decided to
    wear some arm warmers that I had never worn before, with the intention of
    taking them off at some point after starting. I never did and ended up with
    some totally avoidable chafing.

## During the Race

*   Remember: the last six miles is harder than the previous 20. Save your
    energy.
*   Take the Verrazano Narrows Bridge _really_ easy. Consider this as the first
    part of your warm up. You might feel energized by everyone launching
    themselves down the bridge and into Brooklyn, but just let them pass you.
    It should feel as if you’re running backwards with the hordes having to run
    around you. Don’t worry: if you implement this strategy, you’ll pass them
    at mile 20, when it really counts.
    *   I did not do this. Do not do as I do.
*   Give high fives to some kids. Press some “power up” buttons. Take a banana
    or a tissue being offered by spectators, but I’d stay away from the offers
    of free beer.
*   Monitor your watch only occasionally.
    *   [GPS in the city streets is notoriously
        bad](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/09/new-york-city-gps-running-accuracy-test-rabbit-hole.html),
        so don’t be alarmed when your watch says your pace is off by entire
        minutes.
    *   Use the lap function of your watch to monitor your average pace during
        the three different segments: after the Verrazano Bridge but before the
        Pulaski Bridge, after getting into Manhattan but before the Bronx, and
        after getting back into Manhattan but before the finish. 
        *   Some people say to use the lap function to measure every mile, but
            I think this is overkill.
*   Drink lots of water.
    *   Don’t slow down to a walk or a stop until after the water station and
        move to the side. Once you get a cup, move to the middle of the road to
        reduce congestion along the sides.
    *   I like the crumple method to avoid choking or getting water all over me.
    *   Use some decency and drop your used cup to the side of the route.
        Dropping cups in the middle of the street just makes everyone’s lives a
        little bit harder: literally tens of thousands of runners have to wade
        through your trash and unpaid, cold volunteers with rakes have to risk
        their lives in a literal stampede.
    *   Give a heartfelt “thank you!” to the volunteer that is handing you
        water.
*   Remember these cross streets to be able to gauge remaining distance;
    *   The bridge into Manhattan is the _59th_ Street Bridge.
    *   The Willis Avenue Bridge leading to the Bronx starts at _125th_ Street.
    *   The bridge out of the Bronx starts in Manhattan at _138th_ Street.
    *   The entrance into Central Park is at Engineer’s Gate at _90th_ Street.
        You have only 2.2 miles left at that point!

## After the Race

*   Keep walking. Don’t stop, except for pictures (but if you stop for
    pictures, get out of the way). This part of the day was surreal: for the
    first time since the Queensboro Bridge, there is complete silence. The
    runners shuffle painfully, slowly along, with most people covered by a foil
    blanket, some people sprawled out on the ground against the chain-link
    fence trying to recover. It felt like a slow-walking zombie scene.  *   Try
    to consume easy calories while you’re walking to replenish your muscles’
    and liver’s glycogen supplies and your body’s salt supply. Eat and drink
    the stuff in your bag slowly.
*   [New York etiquette
    says](https://nypost.com/2017/11/07/its-tuesday-and-your-marathon-medal-isnt-cool-anymore/)
    that you should proudly wear your medal until midnight. On Monday, wearing
    your medal is unacceptable, with the possible exception of around the
    finish line and the marathon pavillion in Central Park. Tuesday is
    unacceptable with no exceptions.

## The day after the race

*   Visit the [Fred Lebow
    statue](https://untappedcities.com/2015/10/06/for-the-nyc-marathon-frank-lebow-statue-in-central-park-moves-once-a-year/)
    near the finish line and get a picture with your medal. Walk out to the
    park drive near the finish line and visualize what the finish was like for
    you.
*   The line for medal engraving at the marathon pavilion can be very long.
    Arrive early or don’t mind waiting a long time. (My wait was 1.25 hours
    starting at 10:15am, but it was a beautiful day and I didn’t mind passing
    the time by listening to a podcast outside on a crisp, Fall day).
