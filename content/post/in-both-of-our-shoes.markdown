If you, as a parent, choose to not lie to your child about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, are you limiting that child's imagination or heightening their sense of reality? Or are you just producing the kid who ruins the fun for all of the believers. Is that to say that there always is an acceptable level of naivety for a person? Only in the developmental stages? Why? Or, what does that mean for those of us who are knowingly veiled by this naivety but strive for truthful knowledge?

I haven't yet arrived an answer.
