Some notes on my positive interactions with two local business:

**Jacks Art Gallery** - I had two small pieces framed there recently
and both turned out wonderfully. The staff were very helpful in helping
me pick a solution that would make the pieces really pop out. They
even were nice enough to give me hanging hardware and wall bumpers. I
definitely recommend them for fairly inexpensive, quality framing work.

**[Tiecrafters][tie]** - Realizing I had become out of fashion, I
brought both my ties to Tiecrafters to have narrowed into a cool, hip,
new tie. The ties came out exactly as I wanted them. The gentleman
with whom I dealt was extremely kind and accommodating in helping me
pick out a size. Everyone I know has used them, and everyone I know
who has used them loves them. Highly recommended.
