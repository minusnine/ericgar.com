Never before today did I notice the great logo on <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>:

<img src="/uploads/2009/07/git.png" alt="git" title="git" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-464" />

Nor can I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q='git-scm'+logo">find any reason</a> why that is the way it is, but it is most certainly appreciated.
