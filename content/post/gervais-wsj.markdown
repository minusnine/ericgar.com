Ricky Gervais presented a well-written piece on [why he is an atheist]
last month in the Wall Street Journal. He also [responded to some
questions] and his response to the question "How do you plan
on celebrating Christmas?" was striking to me:

> Eating and drinking too much with friends and family. Celebrating
> life and remembering those that did, but can no longer.
> 
> They are not looking down on me but they live in my mind and heart
> more than they ever did probably. Some, I was lucky enough to bump
> into on this planet of six billion people. Others shared much of
> my genetic material. One selflessly did her best for me all my
> life. That's what mums do though. They do it for no other reason
> than love. Not for reward. Not for recognition. They create you. From
> nothing. Miracle? They do those every day. No big deal. They are
> not worshiped. They would give their life without the promise of
> heaven. They teach you everything they know yet they are not declared
> prophets. And you only have one.
> 
> I am crying as I write this.

He goes on in that answer with a touching anecdote about his mother
that is [worth reading].
