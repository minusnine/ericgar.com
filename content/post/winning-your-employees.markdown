I'm a big fan of management practices where management understands they only earn their money because of the employees under them.

McLaren Mercedes was recently punished by the Federation Internationale d'Automobile (FIA) for improperly handling documents containing Ferrari secrets. The penalty was stripping McLaren of all its constructor championship points they earned this season, awarding Ferrari the win in that competition, and fining the team $100 million. (In real terms, McLaren screwed itself out of a lot of money).

The interesting news: It was reported by the commentators of Speed during today's Chinese Grand Prix that McLaren Mercedes management will still pay their employees the promised bonus based on the number of constructor points they <em>would have had</em> come season end. In that move, I see a company that recognizes the importance of its employees and cares about keeping the good people that created a potentially award-winning car. 

Companies have a hidden incentive in treating its workers well. Sure, it's hard to identify exactly how much benefit any given employee has on the bottom line, but it's important to foster an environment that strives for results. Most people will only accomplish that by chasing after the carrot in front of them; one day, the carrot has to be caught for them to continue to the next one. 

While I don't know anything else about the working conditions at the McLaren-Mercedes F1 team, I applaud its management for this decision.
