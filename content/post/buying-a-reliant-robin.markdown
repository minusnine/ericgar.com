I kind of want to trade in my <a href="http://www.automotive.com/2001/12/oldsmobile/alero/photos/index.html">2001 Olds Alero</a> for this:

This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliant_Robin">Reliant Robin</a>, made by a British company which is now defunct, and yes, it only has three wheels. Apparently, there was a version with a Rover (more powerful) engine in it which made installing wheelie bars required. How cool would it be to need wheelie bars on your car?

Admittedly, this decision is mostly because of this:

Where the gents of Top Gear decided to create a reusable space shuttle using a Reliant Robin (because it looked most rocket-like, of course).

Unfortunately, I <a href="http://motors.search.ebay.com/reliant-robin">can't get one</a>.
