title: "An armchair economic analysis of moving walkways"

Walking in the Charlotte Airport inspired me to do some research into
the economics of moving walkways. I'm currently sitting (in a wooden
rocking chair!) in front of one, which clearly illustrates a common
thought: why do people stand on moving walkways?

Often being positioned in areas designed to get you from one
place to another (say, transportation hubs), I think it should be
obvious that moving walkways do not exist to present an opportunity
of leisure and rest, but to propel us faster toward our ultimate
destination.

The paper ["An Armchair View of Escalators and Moving Walkways"][1]
(pdf link) by Roger W. Garrison presents a neoclassical microeconomic
analysis of exactly the trade-offs involved in deciding to stand
or walk, and is an enjoyable, short read.

I'll spoil the ending by giving this quote:

(Perhaps I will now attempt to collect empirical data on moving
walkway usage).
