How much bandwidth do you think Google Reader saves, considering it can aggregate RSS pulls? I'd be really interested to see:

<ul>
	<li>...server logs from a really large blogging site and see how Google interacts with the site.</li>
	<li>...logs from several different sites to figure out how Google staggers them (hopefully distributed randomly), and</li>
	<li>...Google Reader usage statistics to correlate Reader membership to RSS pulls.</li>
</ul>
