title: "Observations on Bicycling in the Rain"
date: "2009-07-26"

Having just arrived home from an evening of company, drink, and debate
(three of my favorite things), I have these observations to make on
riding home in the rain:

1. **Biking in the rain is hella fun.**[^1] The feeling of the rain
pelting against your face, being saturated with water, and having
a brotherhood amongst the other bikers on the route... it's just
awesome. Highly recommended. I'll even go with you, voluntarily.

1. **But it may only be fun if you have eye protection.** I happen to
wear glasses, so I have eye protection wherever I go. It's definitely
worth carrying any type of protective eyewear on a rainy day.

1. **It gives you a really good excuse to clean your bike.** Well,
the frame and exterior bits, anyway. Because all you have to do is
scrub it a bit more and wipe it down. We all wash our bikes far less
than we should.

1. **[Chrome bags][chrome] are also awesome.** The outside of my Chrome
bag: totally saturated with water. The inside? Totally dry. It
wasn't even shut properly by the user, but it came through with
flying colors. While I *love* to this day the backpack for which I
substituted my Chrome bag, it definitely would not have this property.

1. **Your shoes will be squishy.** Okay, not great, but still super fun.
