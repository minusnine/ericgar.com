Yuko and I took a trip to Jackson, WY after falling in love with the Four
Seasons there (where we ultimately didn't stay). We used a voucher from Delta,
which prohibited us from flying into JAC itself, but instead we made a forced
visit to Idaho Falls.

This turned out to be fortunate, as the drive from Idaho Falls allowed us to
pass through Victor and the Targhee National Forest.

## Food

**[Villa Coffeehouse](http://www.villacoffeeandcafe.com/)** - There isn't a
whole lot of non-chain breakfast options in Idaho Falls. We chose to visit this
coffeehouse before driving two hours to Jackson because of their extensive
breakfast sandwich list. Their food didn't disappoint: the breakfast burrito
was delicious. Stick to drip coffee (first refill free) over their espresso
offerings.

**[Grand Teton Brewing Company](http://www.grandtetonbrewing.com/)** - This
brewery is located between Idaho Falls and Jackson. Their tiny tasting room was
a great pit stop. Their beers were great, the popcorn was hot and fresh, and
both the staff and the visitors were convivial. I heard their home-made root
beer on tap was quite good. They have chairs on the deck which looked lovely,
but it was a bit too cold when we visited to take advantage of them. Aside from
delicious popcorn, they don't serve food, but a food truck might eventually
arrive. Get a few special release bombers to go for the evenings in Jackson.

**[Local](http://localjh.com/)** - Upon arriving in Jackson, we walked around
the town center to get our bearings. We came across Local and decided to have
dinner at the bar. As it turned out, Local was already on our shortlist of
restaurants to visit, as T&L claims they have the #2 burger in the area. We
liked the food, the menu, tap list filled with local brews, cocktail list, and
bar service so much we returned a few nights later. (We did see that food was
slow to arrive for some other patrons, however. Pass the time by having another
beer!).

**[Jackson Farmer's Market](http://www.jacksonholefarmersmarket.com/)** - The
market surrounds the town square on Saturday mornings. There are a number of
eateries with stands. The breakfast sandwiches from Sweet Cheeks Meats. Both
sandwiches we had were only okay, but the optional pickled toppings gained some
acclaim. The wait was also long and they were slightly disorganized in handling
orders. We got **massive** donuts from [Nom Nom
Donuts](http://www.nomnomdoughnuts.com/).  I like the plainest of the plain
donuts and had the cinnamon twist; it was quite good, though expectedly too
sugary for me. Yuko had the nutella doughnut, which was filled with a metric
ton of hazelnut spread.

**[Snake River Brewing](http://www.snakeriverbrewing.com/)** - The largest
local brewery, Snake River was on the top of my list because it won Small
Brewery of the Year twice at the Great American Beer Festival. The food is fine
bar food, but otherwise unremarkable: The peach/chorizo pizza was worth trying
if only due to originality (though the barbecue sauce added even too much
sweetness). The pulled pork was average. The beer, though, was great. I had
both of their IPAs on offer: Olde Gregg, an alternative to their best-selling
Packo's, and the I Do, which was specially brewed for the brewmaster's own
wedding. I wish we had the time to come back just for drinks.

**[The Handle Bar at the Four Seasons](http://www.thehandlebarjh.com/)** - I
had wanted to check out the Four Seasons' grounds and their beer and
whiskey-oriented restaurant was conveniently on the way to the hiking trail we
chose. I had completed my bike ride earlier and was starving, so had the
burger, which was excellent, paired with a Deschutes IPA. It was fun watching
the downhill mountain bikers complete their runs from the outdoor,
umbrella-covered patio. The service was impeccable for us, as can be expected
at the Four Seasons. It's worth coming by if you're in the area.

**[Persephone](http://persephonebakery.com/)** - This is a cute little bakery
that you must visit at least once.  Persephone ticked most of the boxes I have
for a breakfast place:

   * They have delicious baked goods: I've never seen Yuko fawn over a
     cinnamon morning roll before).
   * They take coffee seriously (I was warned that my macchiato would be made
     properly, not like most outposts in the midwest; indeed, it was perfect).
   * Their prepared breakfast foods (mostly egg-based) are good (but small).

The biggest downside is that they only offer counter service, which was
distracting: it requires that you listen for your name and make several trips
around their tiny storefront between lots of people and tables.  If it were
warmer out, we would have eaten outside on the deck, which looked lovely.

**[Cafe Genevieve](https://genevievejh.com/)** - We were in need of lunch and
sat down on their patio outside.  The food was only okay (the chorizo tasted
like the Ortega taco mix my mom used to use when I was a kid). The bathroom was
disgusting. The location, right off of the town square, and the seating were
great.

**[Moo's](http://www.moosjacksonhole.com/)** - Yuko is an amateur ice cream
critic and gives Moo's a solid 8/10. She likes the huge variety of flavors
(they serve 24 each day out of their repetoire of 200), the good
chocolate-covered waffle cones, and the organic and locally-sourced
ingredients. She *required* that we return another day for a second cone.
Strangely, you can also resupply for your next paintball outing here.

**[Couloir](http://www.jacksonhole.com/couloir-restaurant.html)** - This was
the surprise of our vacation. While we were sitting at the bottom of the
mountain at The Handle Bar, I mentioned to Yuko that there is a restaurant and
bar at the top of the mountain. She found the last reservation for the
following evening for the last seating of the night, at 8:30pm. They serve a
four-course prix fixe menu with many choices for the first three, with a
dessert sampler to finish.

To get there, you have to take a phenomenal ten minute gondola ride, and
includes a glass of sparkling wine. (In fact, this gondola is how all of their
supplies are transported up to the restaurant as well). The view was fantastic,
though the sun was only up for part of our stay. The food was excellent: we
thoroughly enjoyed every course. The service was on par with the food. The wine
list is so extensive that they have won Wine Spectator awards for their
program. The ride back down via the gondola in the pitch-black darkness was
exhilarating.

I think the winning move here is to book at least one night at the Four
Seasons, have lunch at The Handle Bar, get a reservation for that night at
Couloir, and enjoy the wine and beer in the safety of not having to drive
through buffalo-filled roads.

**[Old Faithful
Inn](http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/lodging/summer-lodges/old-faithful-inn/)**
- After driving to Yellowstone in the morning and arriving at Old Faithful just
before an eruption, we had lunch in the namesake restaurant.  The service was
good, but the food was slow to arrive. The vegetarian reuben was surprisingly
good. The buffet was surprisingly sad looking. If it were a bit warmer, I would
have preferred to get a sandwich from the adjoining cafe and sit out on the
deck overlooking the geyser.

**[Lake Lodge
Cafeteria](http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/dining/lake-yellowstone/lake-lodge-cafeteria/)**
- This cafeteria (in the style of a college dining hall) was along the return
leg of our Yellowstone drive. Its primary purpose is to serve the visitors
staying at the adjoining cabins and campgrounds. It was surprisingly good
cafeteria food: I had a Thanksgiving-style turkey dinner that I wouldn't mind
having again. It was likely the best dinner option we had after a long day of
visiting Yellowstone and having to drive back to Jackson.

**[Nora's Fish Creek Inn](http://www.norasfishcreekinn.com/)** - This
restaurant got put in our travel plans because it won the 2012 James Beard
Award for the American Classic category. As recommended, we came for breakfast,
on our way from Jackson to Idaho Falls. The breakfast burrito with choizo was
phenomenal. The ambiance was rustic log cabin, and there were a lot of locals
in the seats. Come early, come often, but
definitely come.

## Activities

**Running in the [National Elk
Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/national_elk_refuge/)** - This was one of my
favorite runs I've ever done (though I'm not an avid or accomplished runner).
National Elk Refuge Road runs through the entirety of its namesake and starts
right at the edge of town. The surface is fine gravel all the way and it
provides some beautiful views of the surrounding buttes.

**Grand Teton National Park** - I really loved visiting this park. Not only are the
mountains gorgeous, but there are hidden lakes, great drives, and a lot of
wildlife. 

  - *[Hiking Taggart Lake](http://www.tetonhikingtrails.com/taggart-lake.htm)* -
    I would do this easy hike again.
  - *Cycling between Moose and Jenny Lake* - We rented some bikes from
    [Dornan's](https://www.dornans.com/) for Yuko's second bike ride in her
    adult life. The path is set quite away from the road and offers a very
    relaxed ride with amazing mountain views.
  - *Road biking between Jackson and Signal Mountain* - I rented a decent,
    working road bike from [Hoback Sports](http://hobacksports.com/) and did a
    [70+mi out-and-back](https://www.strava.com/activities/370814119) from
    Jackson to the only notable road climb in the park.  Getting out there was
    gorgeous and  the view from the top was stunning, but getting back took a
    bit of extra energy due to a headwind. Gros Ventre/Mormon Row/Antelope
    Flats was a worthy dirt-laden detour to add some variety. [Here's some more
    inspiration for other
    rides](http://theradavist.com/2015/06/riding-in-the-tetons-with-mavic-ryan-wilson/#1).
  - *Getting way too close to bison* - When we were there, a huge herd of bison
    would congregate around Antelope Flats Road near sunset. They seemed like
    such docile creatures, but I'm happy we made it out in once piece!

**Yellowstone National Park** - It isn't possible to spend one day in
Yellowstone and see everything that is worth seeing. We decided to stick to the
lower loop and see whatever we could.

  - *Old Faithful* - Go here first and wait for the next eruption. It was
    surprisingly worth waiting for.
  - *Upper Geyser Basin* - We spent a ton more time visiting all of the smaller
    geysers, fountains and pools that we had expected: they are all so
    different and interesting.
  - *Grand Prismatic Spring* - Amazing colors. Definitely stop.
  - Fountain Paint Pots - Bubbling mud of a variety of colors. I liked this
    more than Yuko did.
  - *Red Rock Hike* - We did this short-but-vertical hike because we thought the
    trail would lead to a great view of the Lower Yellowstone Falls and we
    weren't disappointed. Definitely worth seeing.
  - *Artist's Point* - Totally overrun by tourists, detracting from the beautiful
    view of the canyon. I probably would skip this if I knew about the
    competition from other visitors.

## Accomodations

**Rustic Inn at Jackson Hole** - We researched almost all of the resorts in
Jackson Hole and settled on this one because of the kitschy individual cabins.
The pictures on the website make the cabins look pretty spread out with a view
of the creek and a hillside. In actuality, the cabins are very close together,
and ours had a scenic view and acoustic environment of a parking lot. The
interior of the cabins themselves were nice. The included breakfast was fine
and standard. I would probably look elsewhere for our next trip.

**Holiday Inn Idaho Falls** - *Exactly* as you would expect. It was totally
sufficient for a single night before heading out to Jackson.

## Food, researched but not visited

The following are places that made our list of places to go, but we didn't have
enough time to actually get to.

* **Betty Rock** - #1 lunch according to T&L. The turkey, cranberry, pesto
  sandwich is recommended.
* **Bridger Deck**  - This is the bar located on the lower level of Couloir.
  I'd totally come here for a drink or two, since it includes a gondola ride to
  top of mountain. They are supposed to have a good margarita.
* **DOG Breakfast** - BREAKFAST BURRITO ALERT. I can't believe we didn't come
  here one morning: I keep reading about it after having come back. Call to
  order ahead ahead to avoid a wait.
* **Granary** - Cocktails on a deck with a view. Jazz Friday, piano Saturday.
* **Haydens Post**  Breakfast #3 breakfast - T&L.
* **Idaho Brewing Company** - For obvious reasons. We didn't happen to be in
  Idaho Falls during its open hours.
* **Jackson Hole Roasters Coffee** - Well regarded roastery.
* **Liberty Burger** - Lots of variety. #1 burger according to T&L.
* **Mangy Moose** - Good cocktails, recommended: spicy margarita.
* **Million Dollar Cowboy Bar** - Pretty famous. Saddles for barstools. We
  would have gone even though it isn't really our scene.
* **Pinky G's Pizzeria**  - Pizza On Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.
* **Sweetwater**  - #4 lunch - T&L.
* **Thai Me Up  Thai + Brewery**  Never been to a Thai place that brews their
  own beer.
* **The Lotus Cafe** - Organic/vegetarian/vegan. OMG vegetables would have been
  amazing.
  (Also on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives).
* **The Rose** - Food & Wine top 25 Cocktail bar.
* **Wild Sage** - #1 thing to do for couples - T&L. 7 tables == make reservations.
