I ran the Boston Marathon on April 17, 2023. These are my notes on race
preparation and execution (as usual, mostly written to remind myself about the
experience in decades to come).

## Goals

✓ Goal A: Finish

✓ Goal C: Sub three hours

## Training

I took over a month off after NYC due to COVID and moving house. I decided to
go back to McMillan’s plans after Pfitz 18/70 only because [Greg has a Boston
Marathon-specific race
plan](https:/post/site.finalsurge.com/TrainingPlans/McMillanPlanDetails?product=408434&distance=&timesec=&goaldistance=&goaltimesec=).
I figured specificity couldn’t hurt, especially with the famed hills of Newton
strategically placed right around the bonk mile. Frankly, I also liked being
able to see at a glance from my phone and watch what the workout of the day
was.

With the race on April 17 and my training plan starting in mid-January, this
was the earliest start for a training block I’ve done: NYC is in early November
and Colorado was June 1. This meant that I’d have to train through the winter,
which I figured wouldn’t be bad because I enjoy running in the cold, the sun
always shines, and the snow in Boulder melts quickly. Plus, anything beats
training in the NYC hot and humid summer.

Boy was I wrong. It was a brutal winter and training through it was tough. My
neighborhood was under a sheet of ice for weeks on end, the sun was missing in
action for about as long, and it got _really_ cold. Plus, the damned sun — when
it _is_ out — isn’t out for long in the winter! Just as the sun was rising
acceptably early in March, we hit daylight saving time, and more dark runs
were had. I found myself on a treadmill for more runs than I’d like, including
one long run. 

Training overall went well. I really enjoyed the hill training the plan had me
on and I found a nice little local incline that is perfect for doing some 45-60
second hill sprints. I got sick with a cold that put me out of action for a few
days. I rolled my ankle on a long run in a spectacular one-person crash, but I
was able to finish the run and run on it despite some swelling. (It actually
felt better when running than when not…) I think I stuck to the plan pretty
well, peaking at 66.75 miles (107 km) in late March. The mid-week medium
distance runs were not as long as those prescribed by Pfitz 18/70, which I
appreciated because of the lack of daylight to do them in.

We had been living in a rental apartment that we chose specifically because it
was around the corner from our daughter’s daycare. This made our drop-off and
pick-up routine so easy. But, moving 3.2 miles away from the daycare reasonably
precludes walking; a car or bike are the only ways to go. While the Great State
of New Jersey certifies that my wife is a capable driver since teenage years,
she hadn’t seriously driven in over three decades.

Being the only confident driver/cyclist of the family, I took on drop-off and
pick-up duties. This — coupled with the lack of winter daylight — severely
constrained the amount of time I had available to train. Gone were the days of
being able to get a medium-long run in before showing up at work at 9:30am.

But my wife was extremely supportive. She took on the responsibility for
rousing our daughter from her slumber and getting her ready to get out the
door, to allow me to get running at sunrise or start work early. Not only did
she at times sacrifice her own cherished morning exercise slot, but she also
started to take driving lessons (being uncomfortable with my exacting standards
for driving proficiency) and practiced the route to daycare by herself. It
didn’t help that our Tesla is a little less standard to drive than other cars.

After [my 2:59:59](https:/post/ericgar.com/2022/06/11/colorado-marathon-2022/), I
knew I wanted to target another sub-3 hour time to prove to myself that I’m
capable of running to that standard on a course that isn’t _ridiculously_
downhill. Up through the race, my Stryd analytics complained that I didn’t have
the necessary 296 watts of power sustained for three hours to break that
barrier. I still wanted to try: between using carbon fiber-plated shoes and
running at sea level, I figured the algorithm didn’t know I had a few tricks up
my sleeve.

After having foot pain in NYC the prior fall, I decided to get new shoes a
half-size larger than I typically wear. Soon before I walked into [In Motion
Running](https:/post/inmotionrunning.com/) during a coffee break, Saucony released
their newest carbon fiber-plated shoe, [the Endorphin
Elite](https:/post/www.saucony.com/en/endorphin-elite/), which comes with [“a super
aggressive toe-spring and a propulsive
ride”](https:/post/www.runningshoesguru.com/reviews/road/saucony-endorphin-elite-review/).
I’d like to be sprung and propelled forward toward the finish line, and I have
$275 to drop on something as frivolous for an amateur runner as running shoes,
so that sounded great.

The plan’s 2-ish week taper was longer than I had done previously, though I
will say that the feeling of freshness and the lack of constant fatigue was
really enjoyable. I joined my club for my last long run before the race, but I
probably shouldn’t have: the route was on trails along a rocky goat path with a
good amount of vert. The others in the club going to Boston stuck to the roads
that day…

## Race Weekend

The Boston Marathon traditionally is run on Patriots Day, a local holiday on
the third monday of April. I planned to fly in on Saturday, have a day to pick
up my bib and get settled, and come back home on Tuesday.

I had to bring my daughter to a birthday party for two of her classmates on
Saturday. I knew I had to leave the party at exactly 10:30am to catch the bus
to the airport and discussed this with my family. Sadly, it was only at that
exact time that the party organizing committee was preparing to cut the cake.
Cut to me, carrying my three-year-old daughter away from a party who was
_screaming_, “I want cake!” over and over again... I felt terrible ripping her
away from what I’m sure was a delicious, moist, sugar-filled, homemade cake and
I hoped that she wouldn’t forever associate the Boston Marathon or my running
with the time that daddy pulled her away from the birthday party just as it was
getting good.

(My gracious wife took her to the nearby bakery to get a cupcake and reported
that all was well).

I got to Boston in the late evening and grabbed some [Halal Guys chicken and
rice](https:/post/thehalalguys.com/) from across the street to my hotel, the W. I
entered the hotel, but was confused because it seemed like a club: lots of
people drinking and a DJ spinning. But that was the lobby. I checked in and had
[trouble falling asleep](https:/post/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925054).
By booking through [Whatahotel](https:/post/www.whatahotel.com/), I scored a
$100/day breakfast stipend (among other perks), which was more than sufficient
for carb loading. They also provided a somewhat strange assortment of items in
  a goodie bag for runners, which at least was a nice gesture of hospitality.

I went to the [Tracksmith](https:/post/www.tracksmith.com/pages/trackhouse)
shakeout run and made some great acquaintances. I got some valuable insider
race information, like how the Newton Hills are not that bad, but the underpass
on Commonwealth Avenue going under Massachusetts Avenue at mile 25.8 is the
most brutal hill on the course.

Picked up my bib, contributed to the [Marathon Industrial
Complex](https:/post/www.trailrunnermag.com/people/culture-people/the-boston-marathon-industrial-complex/)
by purchasing an overpriced crappy jacket that I’ll seldom wear, and headed
back to my hotel room to get off my feet. I have some Massachusetts-based
family and they took me out for lunch at [La Famiglia
Giorgio's](https:/post/www.lafamigliagiorgios.com/) in the North End, followed by
[Modern Pastry](https:/post/modernpastry.com/). That meal ended, and an hour later,
the Boulder Track Club’s organized pre-race meal at
[Bencotto](https:/post/www.bencottoboston.com/) started. Two pasta meals in four
hours? Sure, why not.

Can you believe that the 7-11 across the street from my hotel had bread, but
ran out of fancy strawberry preserves while I was gone for the afternoon? I was
forced to make my PB&Js with grape jelly from a squeeze bottle! The indignity.

I got my gear ready, pinned my bib to my singlet, and went to bed for another
night of restless “sleep”.


## Pre-race

I set my alarm for 5:45 to be able to meet my team and get to the buses in
Boston Commons to Hopkinton. While I would have been perfectly content with my
PB&Js until the race start at 10am, the hotel graciously provided an early
continental breakfast for runners.

The bus was fine. Point-to-point courses are amusing to me because it is made
clear how ridiculous it is that we’ve chosen to _run_ the 26.2 miles that we’re
driving in the opposite direction. 

We got off the bus and my teammate said, “We’re not going to the Athlete’s
Village. We’re going to a house.” I learned that one of my teammates is friends
with someone who owns an 1877 Victorian mansion right next to the starting
corrals. Sitting in a comfy antique chair next to a huge radiator sure beats
sitting on a field under a tent on a damp day in the cold. We got better
treatment than even the professional runners in their tent across the street.
The house’s owners even made banana bread for us!

I was happy with my decision to keep my [3 mil contractor
bag](https:/post/www.homedepot.com/p/HUSKY-42-Gal-Contractor-Bags-50-Count-HK42WC050B/202973825)
on until the last two minutes when it started to drizzle. Not cutting holes for
arms made it significantly warmer, but made me look slightly more ridiculous.

## Race

What a fun race. The course is interesting, the requirement for qualification
makes the field more cohesive, and the crowds were invigorating.

(I amusingly had “New York, New York” playing in my head going through the
start line, the song traditionally played at the start in NYC).

My mantra for the day was: “The race starts at the Newton Hills at mile 16”. My
overall plan was to be around 10 seconds per mile faster than goal pace for the
first six miles (10 km), settle into goal pace until mile 16 (26 km), keep the
same effort on and over the hills between miles 16 and 21 (34 km), and then
push as hard as necessary in the last 5+ miles (8 km) to get to the finish line
without much left in the tank.

I also knew that sometimes the way to accomplish a goal is for one to get out
of one’s own way.

A common complaint about the Boston Marathon is that it runs along narrow,
rural roads which creates congestion among runners trying to find their pace.
In my wave and starting from the front of my corral, I didn’t find it that bad.
My first mile was the second slowest mile of my day at 6:57/mi (4:18/km),
slightly slower than my target pace, but I easily accommodated for that in the
remaining 3 miles of strong downhill. One other impact that I hadn’t heard of
previously was that the course was often crowded enough that running tangents
was not feasible; I’m sure I could have taken better lines to cut some distance
out.

The crowds were phenomenal, especially at Wellesley’s Scream Tunnel. What an
experience. My ears were ringing by the time I passed though the campus.

The Newton Hills were a non-issue for me. I was unimpressed when I got to
Heartbreak Hill and saw the penultimate challenge ahead of me. I did start to
feel a little sore in my quads at mile 19 (30.5 km), but I tried to keep it out
of my mind.

I have a bad time with gels. While I’m religious in taking them at 30 minute
intervals, I have problems getting them down. I used to use Maurten
exclusively, but found that I often choke on the consistency of them. I had
switched to Torq gels mostly because they have a more liquid consistency and
have a wide variety of flavors. But, during this race, the acidity of the Torq
gels irritated my throat and caused it to narrow, making breathing a bit more
laborious. Suggestions for alternatives for future races would be appreciated.

All throughout the race, I couldn’t help but have a big smile on my face,
thinking, “_I_ qualified for and am running the _Boston Marathon_.” Thinking
back to me 12 more or more years ago, I couldn’t believe I was even there.

In the last couple of miles, I _felt_ like I was running at a swimmingly easy
6:00/mi (3:43/km) pace. But my watch significantly disagreed every time I
looked down at it until I tried to ramp it back up only to slow down again. The
increased rain intensity definitely didn't help and filled the course with big
puddles. I slipped a couple of times on the wet road paint; the traction on
these Endorphin Elites is not great, seemingly because the contact patches are
very smooth.

I ended up running 6:40/mi (4:08/km) at 303 watts for the first 16 miles, a bit
faster than planned, and ran 6:52/mi (4:16/km) at 291 watts for the last 5.5
miles, a little slower than planned. I ran the first half in 1:27:48 and the
second in 1:30:53.

I ultimately ran at an average of 301 watts, more than necessary to go sub-3.
Eat that Stryd algorithm!

Plus, I beat [Daniel Humm](https:/post/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Humm),
chef/owner of three-Michelin-Star [Eleven Madison
Park](https:/post/www.elevenmadisonpark.com/), by a [handful of
seconds](https:/post/results.baa.org/2023/?content=detail&fpid=search&pid=search&idp=9TGHS6FF181D3C&lang=EN_CAP&event=R&event_main_group=runner&pidp=start&search%5Bname%5D=Humm&search%5Bfirstname%5D=Daniel&search_event=R).

And unlike him, who was on the [Today Show’s cooking segment the next
morning](https:/post/www.today.com/video/try-this-spring-vegetable-baked-rice-for-a-filling-meatless-meal-170575429536),
I didn’t have to work the next day.

## Post-Race

I felt stronger after this marathon than any of the others I’ve ran. I probably
should have tried to run harder in the last 10 km; I may have left some time
out on the course.

Just as I was getting my mylar blanket, the heavens opened up. I made the short
walk back to the W, where they had frames each with a congratulatory message
personalized with our name and finishing time. I stripped out of my sopping wet
clothes and took a long warm shower.

My team had made reservations at [Trillium Brewing at Fort
Point](https:/post/trilliumbrewing.com/pages/fort-point) and at [Row
34](https:/post/www.row34.com/), a beer-centric restaurant. Both were phenomenal
choices; we even ended up going back to Trillium after dinner. Copious amounts
of beer were had.

Now I’m getting psyched for Chicago. It's a flat course near sea level, so
depending on the weather and my training, it could be a good day.
