title = "Camping During Cycle Adirondacks"

+++

Camping at [Cycle Adirondacks](http://www.cycleadirondacks.com/) was the first
time in my adult life that I slept outside with a tent and a sleeping bag. When
I was a kid, we had a standard, multi-room car camping tent and I had a
standard, massive sleeping bag. My parents and I didn’t even know that
being insulated from the ground is a critical element in sleeping outside. The
cold I experienced on those few nights in our front yard explains why I always
thought camping was terrible.

But in adulthood, I started doing more things outside. I started cycling, and
later, visiting national parks and reading about wilderness backpacking. Now,
I’m enamoured by both the *simplicity* of getting away from it all and the
*complexity* of managing basic life functions while out of civilization.

This tour was a good introduction to camping. Now, camping in a town park with
hundreds of people, dozens of portapotties, and a trailer full of showers is a
long way from wilderness camping, but at least it solidified my packing ideas.
I'll be visiting [Grand Teton National
Park](https://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm) again in a few weeks and eagerly
await sleeping under the stars.

But actually, there are two real differences between camping in civilization
for a bike tour and camping in the backwoods: food and cycling gear. 

For this tour, I didn’t need to bring any food or food preparation tools. But,
I did need to bring a crap ton of cycling gear, things like clothes, shoes, a
helmet, gloves, chamois cream, tools, spare parts, etc. I think the volume and
weight of the cycling gear far outweighs the food stuff I’d take on a weekend
trip.

Ultimately, here are the lessons I learned about camping on the Cycle
Adirondacks tour:

*   **Bring earplugs**: Even though one of the campsites was adjacent to a
    waterfall, dampened silence was a wonderful thing. Having tried them all
    via a sampler pack years ago, I like the [Howard Leight Laser
    Lite](http://www.howardleight.com/earplugs/laser-lite) the best.
*   **Sleeping warmth**: I brought a 20°F [Enlightened Equipment
    Revelation](http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/revelation/), based on
    opinions from [Outdoor Gear
    Lab](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Reviews/Enlightened-Equipment-Revelation-20)
    and
    [/r/ultralight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/search?q=Enlightened+Equipment+Revelation&restrict_sr=on)
    and a [Sea to Summit Thermolite
    Reactor](http://www.seatosummit.com/product/?item=Thermolite%26reg%3B+Reactor+Liner),
    mostly to keep my bag clean and partially out of a fear that the 20° bag
    would be too warm for the summer weather. 

    My fear was mostly realized, with the bag being useful only just at the
    lowest low at 50°F, but it was still a great choice because it opens into a
    full quilt. I would have had to choose between boiling or freezing if I
    chose a 20°F mummy bag that doesn't open. Paired with my sleeping bag
    liner, I was able to vary my warmth needs very comfortably. Despite being
    literally see through, I was able to sleep comfortably in just the sleeping
    bag liner until the temperature got down to the mid-50°s.
*   **Tent**: I’m pretty happy about my choice of tent. The [MSR Hubba Hubba
    NX](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/tents/backpacking-tents/hubba-hubba-nx/product)
    two-person tent was perfect for the 5'11" of me plus gear. Out of all the
    tents I saw in use, it was by far the easiest to set up due to its single
    pole design. I like that the fly can be pitched first, on its own, and then
    the body can be attached, which is useful when it rains. The [one-person
    version](http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/tents/backpacking-tents/hubba-nx/product)
    would have been fine; were I to do it over again, I would probably get that
    and save a full pound.
*   **Hammocks**: However, having now understood the disadvantages of sleeping
    on the ground with a thin tent, hammocking is much more attractive.
    (Hammocking would have been impossible in Cycle ADK, however.)
*   **Tent footprint**: Contrary to the general sentiment of ULers, I actually
    like the purpose-built groundsheet and I’m happy I didn’t stress out over
    making my own out of Tyvek. If you’re handy and have the time and space, by
    all means make your own, but if you live in a New York City apartment, feel
    free to disregard the naysayers and trade time for money instead.
*   **Organization**: Think about what you’ll need and when. Keep items used
    together stored together. Keep things you’ll need first, like rain
    protection, at the top of your pack. Keep as much crap outside under the
    vestibules of the tent and in your backpack as possible; this makes life
    simpler inside the tent and makes packing up easier.
*   **Neck support**: A pillow is a great accessory. Sleeping just on my pad
    would have been doable, but uncomfortable. I used the [REI stuff
    sack](https://www.rei.com/product/795043/rei-pillow-stuff-sack) that turns
    inside-out into a pillow, stuffed with my extra clothes, and it worked
    great. I think I might try out the [Sea to Summit
    Aeros](http://www.seatosummit.com/product/?item=Aeros+Pillow+Ultra+Light+)
    pillow since I probably won’t have extra clothes on my next trip.
*   **Laundry**: Washing clothing that won’t be immediately worn or dried out
    is a bad idea. If you wash a piece of synthetic clothing, you can wear it
    and it will dry relatively quickly just from your body heat. Even in direct
    sunlight, clothing can take quite a while to dry fully. If it doesn’t dry,
    it’s going to start smelling really, really bad. Err on the side of not
    washing, I'd say.
*   **Camp clothing**: Bring [long wool baselayer tops and
    bottoms](http://www.icebreaker.com/en/home) to sleep in, even if you don’t
    think you’ll need them. Not having them when they’d be useful sucks, and
    they also help your sleeping gear from getting dirty with sweat.
*   **Minimize toiletries**: Lots of weight could be shed by measuring out
    toiletries into smaller containers that only hold what is needed for the
    duration of the trip. I plan on getting [small, refillable
    containers](http://www.muji.us/store/travel/packing/pe-cylinder-bottle-with-snap-cap.html)
    that will hold just a few days of each substance.
*   **Backpack**: I can definitely live out of my [Osprey Atmos
    AG](http://www.ospreypacks.com/us/en/series/technical-packs/atmos-aura-landing)
    50L backpack comfortably for a few days. Without my cycling gear, my
    backpack had a ton of room. I’m glad I didn’t buy the 65L version. The bag
    was super comfortable, though I really only ever had to transport it across
    a football field.
*   **Avoiding water penetration**: [Trash compactor
    bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BXRGQA) for water protection
    are far, far superior to using a pack cover. In this tour’s case, my
    luggage was dropped off in a field, moved by truck, and dropped off in
    another field before I picked it up. The trash compactor bags were always
    in place, ready to protect my gear, and can’t be as easily removed and lost
    as a pack cover.
*   **Stuff sacks**: Compression and stuff sacks are useless for the most part:
    loose items fill in pack space better. But small items outside of sacks do
    become disorganized. I ditched the stuff sacks for my sleeping bag and pad
    and didn’t miss them. The sleeping bag was stuffed inside of a trash
    compactor bag, which was stuffed in the bottom compartment of my backpack.
    Then, my rolled up sleeping pad, loose bag liner, and sleeping clothes were
    stuffed into the compressed sleeping bag.
*   **Beware of the sun**: Camping on tour is done in fields with no tree
    cover. I wore long pants and a long-sleeved shirt when the sun was out. I’m
    ordering a
    [shemagh](https://www.amazon.com/Tapp-Collections-trade-Premium-Shemagh/dp/B004B8E3E6)
    because additional coverage beyond what my hat provides would have been
    nice.
*   **Water is heavy**: Tighten the rain fly guy lines if condensation causes
    the fly to touch the tent body. (This might be kind of obvious, but I have
    never seen this mentioned in literature).
*   **Plan, execute, observe**: Use [lighterpack.com](https://lighterpack.com/)
    to plan everything you will take with you. Then, use your list as a packing
    checklist. When you’re done with your trip, note what you didn’t use, and
    don’t bring it next time. I have lighterpack lists for both [what I brought
    on this tour](https://lighterpack.com/r/67mlac) and [what I plan to bring
    for my backpacking trip](https://lighterpack.com/r/6chsz6).

Here are cycle tour-specific lessons:

*   **Tent privacy**: Pitching a rain fly is necessary just for visual privacy,
    even if it doesn’t rain. Sadly, this limits ventilation.
*   **Entertainment**: I didn’t use my Kindle at all and I shouldn’t have
    brought it. Instead, I rather enjoyed the tour entertainment, meeting
    people, or even just lying in my tent.
*   **Bike storage**: I should have brought some sort of cover for my bike to
    keep it out of the rain when stored in the communal bike rack. This could
    have been as simple as a strapped-down, oversized trash bag.
*   **Bladder management**: Don’t have a beer just before going to bed. You’ll
    need to get up out of your tent to pee in a dark porta-potty. One person on
    tour had a pee container for just this purpose, but I won’t recommend this
    practice. Instead, actively manage your bladder.
*   **Relax in the morning**: There’s no need to rush in the morning; this
    isn’t a race. Other people set their alarms to before sunrise and
    immediately started breaking down camp. Instead, I had very leisurely
    mornings, and still got on the course in good temperatures. I woke up when
    the sun came up, put on normal clothes, did my morning routine, had
    breakfast, and then got dressed and packed up, all with plenty of time to
    spare.
*   **Avoid chafing**: Definitely bring [chamois
    cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_sore). My favorite is [Chamois
    Butt'r Her'](https://chamoisbuttr.com/her-chamois-buttr/): it works well
    and smells better than the original version.
*   **Repel rain and wind**: Bring a packable rain jacket for on the bike,
    which is also useful for chilly mountainous descents.
*   **Off-bike footwear**: Bringing sandals (specifically, [Made-in-the-USA
    Chacos](http://www.chacos.com/US/en/mychaco/)) was a good idea: they’re
    more versatile than shoes. Pair with wool socks, when needed, for best
    results.
*   **On-bike food**: Bring your favorite snacks and water additives. This is
    useful if you want to deviate from the prescribed route, if you miss a rest
    stop, or the stops don’t have the fuel you want.
