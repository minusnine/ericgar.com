This past weekend, Leah, Casey, Molly, and I attended the second session of the <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/acbf/">2009 American Craft Beer Fest</a> held in Boston. It was a beer lover's dream: 75 American craft breweries offering unlimited samples of 300 of their finest beers (at 2 ounces at a time). This is the place in a beer lover's dream, a place where the last rule about the event was "Respect Beer" with a capital B, a place where one of the most distinct differences between America and the rest of the lot was celebrated, and a place where being a hot Asian girl ______________ .

Below is a list of the beers we sampled. Italics indicates that it was really damn good. Admittedly though, I don't think there was a beer that I wouldn't mind having again.
