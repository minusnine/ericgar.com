I really dislike bragging. To make conversation over your good fortune or situation as if to say, "hi, somehow, in this little insignificant way, I'm better than you" is simply not worth the effort. But, I do like my friends telling me about fortunate sequences of events, good news, or just saying hi, or the like (I especially like postcards or even notecards as one of the best gifts). There is a distinct difference: the former is wanting attention for being somehow more exalted, the latter is sharing, spreading goodwill.

I just want to say that my friends, some new, some old, made my day today. Between a great email, a fun day at work, a great conversation over good beer, and no less than two good packages from friends, today was amazing. This entire week has been good for similar reasons.

Amazing.
