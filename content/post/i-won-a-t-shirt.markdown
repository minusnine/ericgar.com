Hooray! I was one of the first 400 participants in IBM's Master
the Mainframe competition to complete Part 1, giving me this cool,
ridiculously geeky t-shirt:

_IBM took down the image link :-(_

Varun correctly pointed out that the font seems to come straight from
Grand Theft Auto. I'm not quite sure what the allusion means.

I'm still debating as to whether I should complete Part 2. I have
one more step to go and there are a few spots left to qualify for
Part 3, but Part 3 itself is labeled "Approximate time to completion:
Weeks to months." That's a bit intimidating and I think I have better
things to do. That said, I learned more during the first two parts
of the competition over the few days I was working on it than I have
in any one class in a semester. We'll see; continuing depends on my
mood tonight.
