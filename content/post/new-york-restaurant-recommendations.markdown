These are the places I'd go if I were visiting my city, in order
of preference. I sent this exact list to one of my colleagues visiting from Hong Kong.

[Public][1] - My favorite restaurant in the city won a Michelin Star
this year. Great ambiance, interesting dishes, great mixed
drinks.

[El Faro][2] - Really great, real Spanish food, in a super-casual
atmosphere. They've been open since 1927 in the same spot; this was my
parent's favorite dinner date spot. Have the paella a la valenciana,
and/or mariscada with green sauce, and some sangria, then some flan
or laruca for dessert. This place is super packed on weekends; it's
best to go early on a weekday.

[Casellula][3] - A really great, small wine bar in Hell's
Kitchen/Midtown West with an amazing cheese selection and good lite
fare.

[Casa Mono][4] - More upscale Spanish restaurant with an amazing wine
list.

At least one of [Eleven Madison][5]/[The Modern][6]/[Tabla][7]/[Gramercy Tavern][8] -
Danny Meyer's restaurants; Eleven Madison is particularly great
(but more expensive than the others), but all are worth visiting. The
Modern is inside the MoMA, but eat in the Bar Room; the Dining Room is
not worth it. All of them consistently get great reviews and awards,
and are known for their great service.

[La Esquina][9] - Good Mexican street food upstairs (very informal),
dressed up Mexican downstairs (reservations required; good people
watching).

[Tarallucci e Vino][10] - a nice wine bar-turned-restaurant with a good
menu.

I have many, many more, but I'd start with those.
