I've compiled what seems to be a working Intel version of Matthew Rothenberg's NmapFE for OS X out of the CVS tree. See my <a href="http://www.ericgar.com/2007/02/27/cvs-release-intel-nmapfe-for-osx/">previous post</a> as to why this is necessary. It can be <a href="http://www.ericgar.com/uploads/NmapFE-CVS-03-16-2007-ekg-intel.dmg">downloaded here</a>. The md5sum is: <strike>37c6f6269608fdb3d62efbfa58cec123</strike> 36cc7e74f2e17b6c47148bfaa51dce91 

<span><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I made some modifications to the DMG, thanks to Udi's feedback. Download location is the same, the new md5sum is 36cc7e74f2e17b6c47148bfaa51dce91.</span>

I've added this to the README.rtf:

<blockquote>
Addendum: This version was compiled by Eric Garrido. If anyone reading this knows how to contact Matthew Rothenberg, please let me know.

According to Matthew Rothenberg's website for this project (http://faktory.org/m/software/nmap/), this software is released under the GPL. I've included a copy of the GPLv2 (the GPL license available at the time of Matthew's last release) in the disk image.</blockquote>
