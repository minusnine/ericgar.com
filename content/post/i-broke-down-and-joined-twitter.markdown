So as many of my readership found out (all three of you), I've broken
down and joined [Twitter][twitter]. I explained my break down to
[bdotdub][] thusly:

[^1]: Yes, thanks to my core classes at Columbia, I still reference Plato's *[The Allegory of the Cave][all]*.

[all]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave

That's not the whole story. I realized that I'm losing touch with a
lot of my friends, mostly due to my hectic schedule, somewhat due to
being selfish, and a little because I don't have an adequate mechanism
to shoot random ideas at people and get some back. While I think
the idea of writing a less-than-140-character message expressing a
random idea that probably no one will care about is a **useless**
one, the idea of having a friend read my thought and think about
that idea, **having implicitly just communicated with me, is *not*
a bad one**. I get the same in receipt.

That, and it takes little effort to either send or receive, so the
addition of it to my day is non-intrusive.

I'm still on the fence on calling them "tweets" though. I do hate that
they've corrupted the use of '#' to indicate a topic to which to send
"tweets". I hope that '#' will never leave my mind as the IRC chat
room symbol.

Alas, if you'd care to, you can now [follow me at minusnine on
Twitter][follow].
