I was introduced to <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> several months ago. For me, it's an ingenious collection of original content, comprised of talks from some of today's foremost thinkers. And, the vast majority of the speeches are under 20 minutes long, letting one learn about the world while brushing one's teeth even. 

Were I to post all of the clips I think are interesting, I'd end up duplicating TED.com's index. I can't help but share this one below: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/42">Sir Martin Rees discussing the future of Earth</a>. Starting off by stating that he speaks "first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race," he asks the questions that I, hopefully along many others who are much smarter than me, have been thinking about for quite some time. In 17 minutes.
