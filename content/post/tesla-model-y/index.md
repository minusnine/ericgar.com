If you know anything about me, you know how much I hate cars. They [pollute
like
crazy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/climate/driving-emissions-map.html),
take up a lot of space [that could be used for better
purposes](https://www.strongtowns.org/parking), and cause a huge amount of
[human carnage, suffering, and
death](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/introduction/). You
know that I say — despite parents having irrational fears of  their child being
kidnapped, poisoned, or electrocuted — that the most dangerous thing [a parent
can do is put their child into a
car](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsr1804754). You know that I
complain that the government is [beholden to car interests and is obsessed with
growing car infrastructure](https://www.strongtowns.org/nonewroads), even in New York City where the [population of car
owners is dwarfed by that of non-car
owners](https://edc.nyc/article/new-yorkers-and-their-cars).

And yet, I bought a car.

Yuko and I decided to buy a car because we wanted to escape the city on
weekends, mostly to visit her parents so they can see their gorgeous
granddaughter, but also for an occasional day or weekend trips in the area. I
wanted to be able to expose Isla to greener pastures — literally — outside of
the city, while preserving as much social distancing as is reasonable. [We aren't alone in our thinking](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kppab/new-yorkers-are-thinking-about-getting-cars-because-of-covid-19).

Making the decision on exactly _what_ car to buy was a no brainer. First, I
knew I only wanted to buy a totally electric car: climate change is real and, in this day and age, the
technology exists to rival or surpass the internal combustion engine. I also
knew that I wanted an electric car with a range that would allow us to use it
not just as a daily driver, but for longer road trips as well. For example, my
aunt and uncle live 114 miles away. It would be nice to do that round-trip on a
single charge. Next, the car needs to be able to fit a bicycle internally and
have rack options externally. Finally, I want the safest car I can possibly
get, within reason. (The safest car to get is the most massive SUV possible,
but this is impractical for a variety of reasons).

Those requirements narrowed down the field to exactly one car: a Tesla Model Y.

Tesla and its cars are already legendary and have a cult following. Tesla has
done more to greenify car ownership than any other company and have inspired a
huge amount of competition that will get the job done even faster.  Tesla’s
long range models all have north of 300 miles of range (according to the EPA
estimates, anyway). Then, their cars consistently get great crash test ratings,
principally owing to good engineering, a low center of mass due to the
placement of the battery, and a large forward crumple zone as there is no
internal combustion engine.

The “MY” (as forum-posters call it) satisfies the bicycle carrying requirements
without breaking the bank compared to the Model X ($60k+ is already a lot of
money to spend on a moving couch, $100k+ is out of the question.)

Another significant advantage for owning a Tesla vehicle is that they are
currently the only cars on the road that get regular improvements _well after
the car is purchased_ and _over-the-air_. This is unheard of in the automotive
industry. Even the software updates that did exist for other cars — which are
very rare in the first place — would have to be installed at a service center
using the ODBC port.

However, one downside of purchasing a Tesla is that by doing so, one is
supporting Elon Musk. I’m not a huge fan of his personality, his ethos, and his
flamboyant attitude. I think he’s a bad role model and I’m pretty sure I
wouldn’t want to be his employee. That all said, he has accomplished an
astounding amount and has consistently produced, in my opinion, some of the
best products on the market.

## The Purchasing Experience

One other allure of purchasing a Tesla is that I wouldn’t have to interact with
any car salespeople. I’m a pretty strong introvert and I never learned how to
haggle. In prior explorations of car buying, I had been prepared to pay someone
a fee to represent me in the purchase process just so that I wouldn’t have to
deal with the stress of the whole procedure.

Ordering online was as easy as a few button clicks from the comfort of my own
home. No haggling, no pushy salespeople, no price shopping between dealerships.
I didn’t even test drive a Model Y: I was confident enough based on my several
rides as a passenger in other models that the MY would be more than good
enough.

### Order Timeline

*   **August 18th**: I placed my order when the website quoted a delivery
    estimate of 4-6 weeks. 
*   **August 25th**: A week later, I got a text message giving an update
    estimate of 2-4 weeks from then. 
*   **September 3rd**: I was assigned a VIN.
*   **September 4th**: I was asked to select a delivery date between September
    16th and 20th.
*   **September 13**: I was informed that my car would arrive at the service
    center the next day and was asked to come in earlier, between September
    15-17.
*   **September 17**: Delivery day! Almost four weeks to the day.

## Insurance

I shopped around for insurance and found [gabi.com](https://gabi.com) to be a
useful tool.  Ultimately, the insurance agent at State Farm I have worked with
for years and with whom I have all of my other insurance policies (including an
  existing non-owned auto policy), quoted a price that wasn’t unreasonable
  ($125/month), so I just went with that, out of simplicity.

## NYC Monthly Parking

Then I had to find a place to store my giant piece of property that will [mostly
go unused](https://fortune.com/2016/03/13/cars-parked-95-percent-of-time/).

Using the data from [plugshare.com](plugshare.com), which is an excellent
resource for all EV owners, I made a spreadsheet with all of the garages within
a reasonable walking distance from my apartment that have an EV charging
station. I emailed and called all of the companies’ central offices to ask for
a quote; one got back to me quickly (thank you Ayelet at GGMC!), others never
returned my calls. I ended up walking to many of the garages the day before
taking delivery and just asking to talk to the manager. 

Unfortunately for our wallet, we live in the [middle of literally the most
expensive neighborhood to park in literally the most expensive city to park in
all of the United
States](https://investinganswers.com/articles/most-ridiculously-expensive-places-park-america).
It's no secret that space is at a premium here in Midtown Manhattan. I
initially received quotes ranging from $550 per month with no charging charge
at the GGMC garage on East 44th Street up to a whopping _$1000 per month_ from
Icon at 330 E 39th St  ([The Tesla parking tax is
real](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/what-to-do-about-nyc-public-garage-gougers.180329/)!).

Luckily, I stopped by an iPark in what turns out to be an excellent location:
as far away from midtown as possible while still being super-convenient. They
offered $450 with no charging fee. Done and done. I signed up on the spot.

## Taking Delivery

{{< img "car-shop.jpg" "My MY at the Brooklyn Service Center" "Picking up the car. It suffers from a <a href=\"https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/does-pearl-white-issues-still-exits.205819\">well-known color mismatch betwen the plastic bumper to the metal body</a>. It's barely noticable in most lighting conditions, so I don't care." >}}

These are the facts I would have liked to know before the delivery process
started:

*   **All deliveries happen at the Brooklyn Service Center** (SC), which is
    quite far away. I falsely assumed that the location in Manhattan does
    deliveries as well, but it is just a showroom.
*   **Pick up or else.** While you get to choose a date for delivery, the car
    may arrive at the service center early. According to the Motor Vehicle
    Order Agreement you signed, you have only three days to take possession of
    it after it is available. If you don’t, it gets reassigned and you start
    the waiting process again, regardless of the date you chose originally.
*   **Opt-out of arbitration.** The Motor Vehicle Order Agreement also
    specifies that you can opt-out of arbitration, but only in the 30 days
    after signing that contract. It’s probably worth doing.
*   **Bring a checklist and don’t skip anything.** Quality control is
    practically non-existent; there are tons of stories in various forums about
    things that were wrong with the car at time of delivery, including an
    instance of [the entire sunroof flying
    off](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502379/tesla-modely-roof-flies-off-convertible-quality-issue)
    on the drive home. I used [this
    checklist](https://github.com/polymorphic/tesla-model-y-checklist), which
    worked very well to find a couple of minor issues (minor, but shouldn’t
    have existed in the first place), some of which were immediately remedied.
    I didn’t test the mobile charging cable, though, because the car was
    plugged into a Supercharger while I was inspecting it; lo and behold, the
    mobile charging cable was partially defective and had to be replaced later.
      * Point out all problems to your Tesla Advisor before taking ownership of the car.
*   **All owners _do not_ have to be present at delivery**. The people who
    are on the title but not present can grant you limited power of attorney to
    represent them. Tesla sent me literally [this
    form](https://eforms.com/power-of-attorney/ny/new-york-motor-vehicle-power-of-attorney/)
    so that my wife could grant me power of attorney; note that it must be
    signed in front of a notary and notarized.

## Things I love

1.  **Lower carbon emissions**. It's nice to not directly contribute carbon to
    the atmosphere while still having the mobility that car ownership brings.
   
    > Transport accounted for 28% of global final energy demand and 23% of global
    > energy-related CO2 emissions in 2014… The transport sector is the least
    > diversified energy end-use sector; the sector consumed 65% of global oil
    > final energy demand, with 92% of transport final energy demand consisting of
    > oil products.
    >  
    > \- [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/)
   
    Human-instigated climate change is real. While the biggest impact in
    mitigating it [requires a top-down shift in
    priorities](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/) (e.g. funding for
    green energy sources, phased elimination of fossil fuel use, agricultural
    practice changes, avoiding deforestation, etc), doing what we can on a
    personal level does help some and does raise awareness of the larger issues.
    A conversion to electric vehicles is a middle ground that allows us to
    eliminate an important source of carbon emissions, dependency on fossil
    fuels, and promote growth of non-carbon energy production.
    
    [Owning an EV is only a net good compared to owning an
    ICE](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change)
    and is strictly worse than not owning a car at all. There are still plenty of
    side effects of any car ownership: all of the infrastructure that supports
    EVs still consumes fossil fuels, from EV production through to service and
    road maintenance, and of course, when charging.

2. **Crash safety**: Tesla vehicles routinely [get the top marks from the IIHS
crash
testing](https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/tesla/model-3-4-door-sedan/2020).
This article breaks down [exactly what design characteristics contribute to
this high level of
safety](https://evannex.com/blogs/news/why-tesla-electric-vehicles-are-safest).
3. **One-pedal driving**. By default, the Tesla software heavily engages the
   regenerative braking system when pressure is removed from the accelerator
   pedal. This allows the driver to use a single pedal to control the forward
   velocity of the car. It feels like the [slot cars I had as a
   kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car) that use a trigger to go around
   a track.
4. **Software updates**: As mentioned earlier, my car has _already_ gotten
   better in the one month that I’ve owned it. Two software updates have rolled
   through that added new features and made bug fixes. Another huge one [is
   coming](https://electrek.co/2020/10/22/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-look-insane/)
   that enables Autopilot in city environments.
5. **The Supercharger network**: In the NYC area, the Supercharger network is
   good enough that I mostly never have to worry about range: I could always
   drive to the nearest Supercharger. While a 0%-100% charge takes 75 minutes,
   it’s rare to need to do that; 150 miles of range can be had for 20 or 25
   minutes. No other EV has as reliable a charging network that is as fast,
   ubiquitous, and whose presence is growing.
6. **Having a ginormous map**: When I was a kid, one of my favorite books was
   the massive National Geographic Atlas of the World on our bookshelf. I’d
   just flip through the pages and study the maps. Having a huge map in the car
   feels similar and totally beats navigating using a tiny phone screen.
7. **The minimalist interior design**: My mother-in-law recently leased a
   [Mercedes Benz C63S
   AMG](https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/model/c-class/sedan/c63ws), which has
   503 horsepower and a 0-60 time of 3.8 seconds. (Why she needs all of that
   power is beyond me. Plus, the cost of all that power is a ridiculously bad
   18 mpg city fuel economy.) The cockpit [is complicated as all
   heck](https://www.google.com/search?q=c63s+amg+cockpit), with buttons,
   knobs, switches, touch interfaces, multiple screens and a huge range of
   configuration options. In contrast, the [MY is
   ascetic](https://www.google.com/search?q=model+y+cockpit): has almost no
   buttons, has no knobs or switches, and has exactly one touch interface that
   is the screen. (And it has a better 0-60 time).
8. **Truly keyless entry**. A lot of cars have what they call “keyless entry”
   by supplying you with an additional fob with a transponder inside. Tesla
   takes this a step further and makes your phone — which these days, everyone
   already carries all of the time obsessively anyway — your key. Not having to
   carry a separate object for the car is pleasant.
9. **Car control from the phone**: I used to think people who got remote
   starters installed in their car were silly. Now that I can control a whole
   range of functionality remotely, I totally get it. Being able to see how
   charged the car is or turn on valet mode from a distance has actually turned
   out to be pretty useful, especially since the car is several blocks away
   from my apartment.
10. **The idea of going car camping**: I’m excited to eventually make my
    daughter my backcountry camping partner. (We’ll see if this _actually_
    works out!) There are a few milestones along the way, though, and one of
    the introductory ones might be driving to a campsite and sleeping in the
    car. Tesla models can be plugged into a standard RV charging outlet and
    there is no internal combustion engine that needs to run to keep the air
    conditioning on. Plus, an [Exped MegaMat Duo
    10](https://www.rei.com/product/113720/exped-megamat-duo-10-sleeping-pad)
    sleeping pad fits [almost perfectly in the
    back](https://i.imgur.com/u8Mmoja.jpg) with the seats folded.
11. **The built-in dashcam and video security system**: These should be
    standard equipment on any car these days.
12. **Minimal scheduled maintenance**: No oil changes, no oil or fuel filter
    changes, no coolant replacement, etc. This is especially nice living in NYC
    where getting these things done is a real hassle. There are still a [few
    things to do](https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance) once in a
    while, though.
13. **Mobile service**: A repair technician will _come to your car_ (for some
    types of repairs or diagnosis), often for free, without you having to do
    anything. This is superbly convenient.
14. **Chill Mode**. In any car, I like to drive in a way that maximizes comfort
    for my passengers and maximizes energy efficiency. Chill Mode reduces the
      otherwise crazy acceleration available and allows me to not have to worry
      about this so much. Yes, the MY’s 0-60 time is impressive by most
      standards, but I keep Chill Mode on all the time (though it would be nice
      to have a way to quickly toggle it!).
15. **Valet Mode**. Keeping the car in a valeted garage means that a bunch of
    people routinely drive it. Valet Mode keeps my favorite addresses hidden,
    reduces the top speed available, and prevents access to the glove
    compartment.  This adds a little extra comfort in handing over the key to a
    stranger.

## Things I dislike

1.  **Range anxiety**: The stated range for the car when I purchased it was 316
    miles. (It has since increased a few miles with a software update). When I
    charge to 90% of capacity, the stated range is 291 miles. But these numbers
    are based on perfect conditions of driving and do not take into account any
    external factors, like elevation changes or your driving style. So, it’s
    easy to become paranoid about available range as superchargers are still
    not as ubiquitous as gas stations.
   
    The car _does_ have a few features that make it somewhat hard to run out of
    battery, especially if you use the navigation system: 

    1. It will display the estimated percentage of battery that will be left
       available upon reaching the destination, and how much battery will be
       left after a round trip. In my experience, this estimation has been very
       accurate.
    2. It will automatically reroute you to a Supercharger if it predicts that
       you will be unable to make it to the destination.
    3. It will warn you as you leave the range of all known Superchargers.
    4. It will suggest lowering your speed to specifically make it to the
       destination (which works because slower speeds are significantly more
       efficient; thanks inverse square law!)
    5. Even when not using the navigation system, the “Energy” tab displays the
       estimated available range, based on recent driving history.

    Even knowing this, range anxiety can persist. It takes time and experience
    to trust all of these features.

2. **Lack of safety features that are standard on every other car in MY’s
   class**. The complete absence of blindspot warning and rear cross-traffic
   warning is inexcusable. As far as I can tell, it comes down to the fact that
   Tesla doesn’t want to pay royalties for patents. Elon Musk claims that a
   reconstructed birds-eye view is coming in a future software update.
3. **Lack of regular cruise control**: Enabling “Traffic-Adjusted Cruise
   Control” also enables automatic braking. Ordinarily, this sounds great,
   except for the presence of phantom braking. See the section about Autopilot
   below.  Absence a perfectly working TACC, I just want a regular, old, “stay
   at this speed” cruise control.
4. **Back seat passengers cannot control climate and heated seats**: Since all
   of the controls are accessed via the touchscreen upfront, the rear
   passengers have to ask the forward passengers to manipulate the climate
   controls. If the rear passenger(s) have their phones enrolled via the Tesla
   app, they can turn on and off the heated seats and change the temperature,
   but they cannot control the rear vent.
5. **Easy-to-curb rims**: Most car manufacturers supply the car with tires that
   exceed the dimensions of the rim. This protects the rim against running into
   a curb, as the tire’s sidewall will come into contact with it first and
   provide feedback to the driver. Not so in Tesla vehicles, resulting in rims
   that are easily scratched.
6. **Tesla communication**: Getting in touch with a real human at Tesla is a
   challenge. This is in comparison to my previous car, where I could drive to
   the dealership in town and speak to the dealership owner and mechanics
   directly, 
7. **Lack of Android Auto**: Modern Android Auto integration into cars where
   the manufacturers care about this is really great. Tesla went their own way
   and created their own human interface without rich phone integration. As it
   turns out, I rarely need to use my phone while I’m in the car (and _never_
   while in motion!) because the main console has everything I need and more.
8. **The cult following and its opposite**: Tesla is under the spotlight right
   now as it is pushing the entrenched automobile industry in a radically
   different direction. This has created two distinct camps in online message
   boards: those who are fanboys and will defend Tesla to a fault and those who
   just want to vent their discontent with Tesla. This gets annoying and
   distracting from productive conversations. A lot of these people don’t even
   own a Tesla.
9. **The fragile frunk hood**: Unlike the hood of a normal car, which is
   normally made out of robust steel to protect the internal combustion engine,
   the MY’s frunk (front trunk) hood is thin aluminum. This means it is very
   easy to dent the hood through normal operation. Tesla even has specific
   instructions in the manual as to how to close the frunk to try to avoid
   dents.
10. **The huge number of gimmicks**. Summon (which usually fails). Smart summon
    (which doesn’t have an actual purpose). Fart mode (no explanation needed).
    The fact that Tesla is [hiring a whole team to produce
    games](https://electrek.co/2020/08/31/tesla-video-game-user-interface-team-austin/).
    All of this is wasted engineering effort that could be better spent
    elsewhere.

## Autopilot

Autopilot deserves its own heading because I love/hate it. It is supremely
useful in the narrow window of conditions it is good in and it has such a high
amount of promise to improve. But, there are so many problems with it that I
often don’t feel comfortable trusting it while my family is in the car.

There are some distinct classes of problems that we’ve experienced so far:

1. **Phantom braking**. When traffic-aware cruise control (TACC) is engaged,
   the car sometimes senses an object that it needs to avoid by slamming on the
   brakes. This most often occurs just before overpasses or just as we reach
   the crest of a hill. We’ve been lucky that there were no cars behind us
   during these episodes.
2. **Swerving during lane expansions**: Many on-ramps do not have a broken line
   to demarcate the travel lane from the on-ramp. In these cases, the car will
   swerve toward the on-ramp to center itself within the existing lane marking.
   This is pretty dangerous when there are cars merging into traffic; this
   basically prohibits using TACC in the right-most lane or requires manual
   intervention for each exit.
3. **False stop lights**: Admittedly in beta, the car can sense and react to
   stop signs and traffic lights. Sadly, on multiple occasions, the car sensed
   a red light intended for the off-ramp of an exit and proceeded to brake for
   a stop in the middle of the highway.
4. **Navigate on Autopilot erratic behavior**: When Navigate on Autopilot is
   engaged, the car should automatically perform a lane change into the exit
   lane and change lanes to maintain speed. This has gone wrong in a bunch of
   ways, from the benign (moving to the passing lane which would cause a missed
   exit) to the downright dangerous (in an exit where two new exit lanes
   suddenly appear, the car moved into the first exit lane, swerved into the
   second, only to abort that lane change and swerve back into the first).

I’ve been supremely attentive while Autopilot is active and can now anticipate
when most of the above problems will happen. Even still, I don’t like scaring
my family with unexpected or sudden movements, so I’ve significantly curtailed
my use of Autopilot while they are in the car in heavy traffic or in
construction zones.

Autopilot is really good for those long stretches of isolated highway where
there is little traffic and where you are sitting in the middle lane of a
three-lane highway. It does a good job of following the car in front of you
and, if necessary, change lanes around slower-moving vehicles. It also does
really well in stop-and-go traffic. In the short while that I’ve had the car, I
can see how driving with Autopilot in this scenario allows the driver to feel
much more relaxed during and after the trip: I definitely expend less energy in
doing mundane lane and speed keeping.

## Accessories

So far, I have bought a few accessories for the car.

1. **[Matte Screen
   Protector](https://abstractocean.com/products/m3y-premium-tesla-screen-protector)**:
   The glossy screen attracts a lot of noticeable fingerprints and can have a
   significant amount of glare early or late in the day. This matte screen
   protector helps on both fronts.
2. **SanDisk 128GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive**: To enable sentry mode and
   the dashcam. There is a whole website that discusses at length [exactly
   which storage device to buy](https://cammem.com/) for these functions, but
   it really overanalyzes the issues of wear and durability. It suggests
   purchasing an Endurance SD card, intended for continuous recording, in
   tandem with an USB SD card reader that can withstand hot and cold
   temperatures. Some people go as far as buying a huge SSD. In fact, there are
   exactly two flash drives mentioned in the car’s manual that are stated as
   working just swell; this is one of them.
3. **Emergency Kit**: I believe in the Boy Scout motto: “Be prepared.” I
   assembled and installed an emergency kit consisting of a first aid kit (FAK)
   and a break-down kit. The FAK which will likely be used for run-of-the-mill
   boo boos, but also includes tourniquets, chest seals, hemorrhage control
   items, a CPR mask and other such supplies. The break-down kit includes some
   LED flares, a tire pressure gauge, a mini compressor, some space blankets, a
   headlamp, and similar items.
4. **14-50 Adapter**: This adapter for a common receptacle type used to be
   standard issue in prior Tesla models and allows the car to be charged more
   quickly.
5. **TT-30 RV Adapter**: I bought this in preparation for hooking up at an RV
   campsite. Sadly, I bought the cheap one off of Amazon, which I wouldn’t
   recommend. The right one is the [TT-30 adapter from EVSE
   Adapters](https://www.evseadapters.com/products/tt-30-adapter-for-tesla-model-s-x-3-gen-2/),
   which has temperature monitoring and proper communication to the car about
   amperage.
6. **25' 12-gauge extension cord**: For plugging into a household garage outlet
   while the car is outside. Be sure to get at least a 14-gauge cord, as most
    cords are not rated for continuous operation at 80% of the circuit maximum
    (about 12 amps). A 12-gauge extension cord buys some extra insurance.
    Remember: a warm cord is okay, but a hot cord is not.
7. **[A generic game
   controller](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/f310-gamepad.html)**:
   for better control of the in-built games.

    just to see how they are built, but who doesn’t really want to take apart
    their very expensive car, I consider this video series a goldmine.

    work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgmBpEQtJ1s&list=PLQnJmLM66DRSIEWb43TzuBpWHKU1Zfll6&index=1)**:
    An often-cited feature of the MY (and now recent Model 3s) is the use of
    the “Octovalve” and a heat pump to flexibly move heat from parts of the car
    that need cooling to parts of the car that need heating, reducing the use
    of the expensive resistant heating. These diagramatic videos were the best
    way to understand all the modes of this system; it is much more accessible
    than [the relevant patent
