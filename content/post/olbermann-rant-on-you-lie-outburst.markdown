This is a purely amazing rant on Joe Wilson's "You lie!" outburst during Obama speech:

This is just true:

<blockquote>
It is this week evident that the greatest threat to the nation, is not
terrorism, nor the economy, nor H1/N1, nor even bad health care. It
is rank, willful stupidity.

When did we come to extol stupidity ahead of information, and rely on
voo-doo, superstition, and prejudice ahead of education?  </blockquote>
