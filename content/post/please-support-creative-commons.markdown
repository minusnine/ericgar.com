The <a href="http://twitpic.com">Twitpic</a> <a href="http://twitpic.com/terms.do">Terms of Service</a> currently reads:

<blockquote>
By uploading your photos to Twitpic you give Twitpic permission to use or distribute your photos on Twitpic.com or affiliated sites

All images uploaded are copyright their respective owners 
</blockquote>

I sent the following to the generic email address publicly available, even though Twitpic a service I only use as a content consumer, not as a content producer:

Twitpic,

Please consider supporting Creative Commons by allowing new users to 
specify to license their content by default under one of the available 
licenses, and specifying per-work that a CC license may or may
not apply.

Creative Commons makes for a more useful internet and should be 
actively encouraged where there is a democratized content creation 
arena.

Please consider making the internet even better by allowing your 
users the choice of Creative Commons.

Thanks,
Eric Garrido

<span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is an organization that has published a set of standardized, but evolving, copyright licenses intended to increase content sharing on the internet. As a content producer, you can choose who can use your work and in what manner. For example, this blog is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License</a> which allows normal people to repost whatever I've written as long as it is used non-commercially and they cite where the content came from.</span>

Creative Commons is basically a legal democratizer for the internet. It allows you to <em>share</em> the content you've published publicly, since all content is immediately covered under a strict copyright law unless otherwise specified.

Please think about publishing your own work (on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">Flickr</a>, your blog, or elsewhere) under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">one of the Creative Commons licenses</a>.
