<ol>
	<li> The fact that I have two tickets to the New Kids on the Block show at MSG.
<a href='/uploads/2008/07/img_0240-modified-1.jpg'><img src="/uploads/2008/07/img_0240-modified-1.jpg" alt="" title="img_0240-modified-1" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-240" /></a>
</li>
	<li>The fact that <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/washington/10fisa.html">Congress decided corporate lobbyists with money are more important than our civil liberties</a></strong> by voting for telecom immunity and expansion of domestic spying.

(Though, there is a <a href="http://www.markfiore.com/spies_who_love_you_0">snuggly bear who tells me it is a good thing</a>. I don't trust snuggly bears as bears have claws).
</li>
	<li>The fact that <em>Barack Obama</em>, "the harbinger of government change", <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/blogtalk-obamas-fisa-vote/">reversed his previous stance</a> by <strong>voting for the corporate lobbyists with money</strong>. He refused to stand up to them and do the right thing, making him no different from any other politician. I would have loved for him to champion support against this bill, I would have settled for his individual vote against it, but I <strong>cannot</strong> accept his vote for it.
</li>
	<li>The fact that <em>both</em> Senators Schumer and Clinton of New York voted <strong>against</strong> this telco amnesty bill. At least <em>they</em> had the guts to stand up to the Bush administration.</li>
</ol>

End result?

<strong>Epic fail.</strong>
