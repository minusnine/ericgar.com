I was reading through the [TLC Rules for Taxicab Drivers][rules]
(pdf) to satisfy some curiosity after reading through several posts
from the entertaining blog [Cabs Are For Kissing][cabs], written by
a cabbie about stories from the job. I found these amusing sections:

[rules]: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/drivrules.pdf
[cabs]: http://cabsareforkissing.blogspot.com/

> &amp;sect; 2-42 Courteous.
> 
> (a) A driver shall be courteous to passengers.

It turns out that from &amp;sect; 2-86 a violation of this section is a
$150 fine.

> &amp;sect; 2-44 Luggage and Property.
> 
> (b) A driver shall not transport for hire any property, except blood
> or vital human organs, unless such property is in the possession of
> a passenger.

I find it funny that this exception exists. Is it normal for hospitals
to give these items to cabbies for transport alone?
