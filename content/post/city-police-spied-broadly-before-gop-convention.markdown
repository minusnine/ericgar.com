<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/nyregion/25infiltrate.html">NYTimes - City Police Spied Broadly Before G.O.P. Convention</a>

This was from/featured in the <a href="http://www.the-fifth-hope.org/hoop/">Fifth HOPE</a> the month before the convention:
<blockquote>Other digests noted a planned campaign of “electronic civil disobedience” to jam fax machines and hack into Web sites. Participants at a conference were said to have discussed getting inside delegates’ hotels by making hair salon appointments or dinner reservations. At the same conference, people were reported to have discussed disabling charter buses and trying to confuse delegates by switching subway directional signs, or by sealing off stations with crime-scene tape.</blockquote>
