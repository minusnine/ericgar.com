title: " In the future, we will not be iPhones"

[My good friend and esteemed colleague][bwong] has posted his thoughts
on "[Why I think the iPhone is Important][iphones]". [^1] He adopts
the opinion that "the big advantage Apple has with the iPhone is that
they control the entire product, top to bottom." He compares the iPhone
to the Android platform and says, "iPhone >> android => Apple!"

[^1]: As in any post that ends in "Shabowza," it is very intellectually deep and only fit for the philosopher-king.

Okay, so that quote was actually me summing up the argument.

I agree with his assessment that the iPhone has a great user
experience. Everything is _pretty sharp_. Its components _feel_
like they belong together. Things just _flow_.

But it is still a **closed platform**. One where you cannot publish
software without Apple's acceptance. One where usage of the device
outside of Apple's vision is prohibited. One where the power of a
single entity has control over the utility of the platform.

This may be good for "user experience" but is horrible for the user. Is
this an acceptable compromise?

If the user is limited in the usefulness of a device, knowingly or not,
the user loses. There is no reason for Apple to be authoritarian on
this matter. Users deserve a choice to do what they would like with
their own devices.

Could you imagine what computing would have been like had Microsoft
said, "We will give the masses this platform called Windows, but
we will control the vertical stack. We will not allow external
innovation. We will not allow other people to be creative, unless
that creativity is synergistic with our platform strategy. We will
control computers 'top to bottom'."

This too might have been good for "user experience." But, this would
have been **horrible for the user**. (We would **be forced** to use
IE. There would be no such thing as Firefox.) This would have been a
very bad thing for personal computing in general. And it could have
happened. It did not because market forces did not give Microsoft
the gift of inventing the hardware.

This is what Apple is doing with the iPhone.

That Apple created its hardware base does not make it any
different. This authoritarian control will be a very bad thing for
mobile computing.

I'd agree that Android is flawed for various reasons. It's hard to
program for a device that doesn't exist. And **it's hard to
program for multiple types of devices**.

This was one of the downfalls of the Windows CE development back
in the early 2000s. Multiple processors, multiple screen sizes,
and multiple input methods all made it difficult for a programmer
to appeal to a wider audience. Standardization is a powerful thing;
Apple has de facto standardized its hardware platform, allowing
software developers to be able to predict usage patterns.

This is kind of like the rest of the computer industry: A programmer
knows, with some exceptions, that the person using his software will
have a screen that is wider than it is tall, have buttons to press
to input characters, and have a method to move a cursor around on
the screen.

This standardization does not mean that the user has to sacrifice
user experience. Nor does it mean the user must sacrifice the freedom
of choice. Standardization at lower levels is a very powerful force
that pushes developers to creativity. Standardization could have
occurred at the hardware level and then Apple could have provided an
open interface for alternative operating systems and programs. Apple
could have invented the physical parts, but leave the bits in
memory to be manipulated by the end user as he or she pleases. Apple
could have given _their_ operating system and _their_
software as the default choice, **but allowed users to chose
otherwise**.

I sit here typing this post on a Apple MacBook Pro running Linux 2.6.24
in a text editor whose source code I can download and change. Apple
created the physical parts but _I_ own the information. **Does this
use of their hardware design harm Apple or Apple's brand in any way?**

No. It allows them to have another happy customer, while all of the
customers who choose the default on their systems being happy as
well. **This is how it could be on the iPhone.**

Give people the choice. Never think that a closed platform is an
advantage.

Recently, [Jeremy Clarkson][clarkson] began a segment on [Top
Gear][topgear] about the new Ferrari Scuderia with, "Do you know what's
wrong with Ferrari at the moment? They're nerdy. It's all about the
plumbing and the wiring and the computer systems. When I drive a
Ferrari, I want it to be all about _passion_. And _excitement_."

Then he drives it. He ended the segment with, "I cannot tell you how
happy it makes me feel to be driving a proper Ferrari again."

**A flashy user interface, cohesive user experience, and an open
platform are not mutually exclusive goals.**
