Saw this on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a> today:

<blockquote>
<strong>About</strong>: [some open source project] is a real-time collaboration (RTC) server. It uses the only widely adopted open protocol for instant messaging, XMPP (also called Jabber). [some open source project] is incredibly easy to setup and administer, but <em>offers rock-solid security and performance.</em>

<strong>Changes [in the new version]</strong>: <em>A security flaw allowed authentication to be bypassed, allowing arbitrary code execution</em>. This was fixed. JDBC and JID optimizations were done. 
</blockquote>

(Emphasis mine).

Wait, really? rock-solid security != arbitrary code execution, last time I checked.
