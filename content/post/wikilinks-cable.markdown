With today's historic [WikiLeaks release][wiki] (which has been undergoing a
[DDOS] of unknown origin; so here's the [NYT coverage]), I couldn't
help but think of the closing of [The Hacker's Manifesto][hack]:

I support today's release. Democracy was never intended to be conducted
behind closed doors. A government is responsible to its people --
not the other way around -- and both would do well to remember that:
history shows that governments are expendible, but the citizenry
is not.
