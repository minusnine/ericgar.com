I'm a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware">open source hardware</a> as it <a href="http://arduino.cc/">lowers the barrier to entry</a> for <a href="http://ericgar.com">a software geek</a> to dabble in RL fabrication. 

Now, you can build your own large hadron collider, as a series of articles <a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/journal/-page=extra.lhc/jinst">detailing its components</a> has been published. I, for one, intend for this to be my next project.
