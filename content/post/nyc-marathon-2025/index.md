I received an unexpected email in March from the [New York Road
Runners](http://nyrr.org) with the subject “Claim Your Entry to Run on
November 2!” and got very confused. I had already used all of my 9+1 guaranteed
entry slots left over from when I lived in New York (2019, 2022, 2024). I
thought it must have been an error and they’d send a correction email shortly
thereafter.

No such email arrived. I texted my friend, who pointed out, unbeknownst to me,
that the guaranteed entry time for males 40-44 is 2h58m and I qualified with
two minutes to spare from my 2024 NYC Marathon time! Sweet! Despite continual
ranting about the logistical overhead of getting to the NYC Marathon start line
and swearing off ever running the race again, I decided to defer my Chicago
entry to next year and run New York instead.

These are my notes on race preparation and execution (as usual, mostly written
to remind myself about the experience in decades to come).

## Training

My daughter was scheduled to be born about a month after the [2024 New York City
Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/12815303054) and I knew life would
be constrained thereafter. I decided to cross one last-minute item off of my
bucket list: running Boulder’s iconic [Skyline
Traverse](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/boulder-skyline-traverse-co), a
17.3mi, 5,846ft gain route that summits three local peaks. I was led by three
of my favorite running partners, all of whom have way more trail running
experience than I do. It was a fantastic experience packed with [type-2
fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale). But, I managed to twist my
ankle a couple of times toward the end of the run, which turned out to be an
injury I ended up having to nurse throughout training in 2025.

After Reina was born in early December 2024, I intentionally took through
mid-March mostly off from running and entirely off from training. I had some
ambition to train a bit for the [BOLDERBoulder
10k](https://www.bolderboulder.com/) on Memorial Day, a local staple, but my
training ended up being haphazard and unfocused, and mostly just endurance
paces. BOLDERBoulder didn’t go super well; it became obvious that I lost a lot
of fitness during my time off.

{{< img peanut.jpg "I was happy to have found the NUTMobile during a run!" >}}

My poor result inspired me to get back to serious training. I started the
[McMillan hill training
plan](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/plans-details/hill-module-level-5/) at
the beginning of June and could feel fitness returning week by week. This
coincided with starting three months of baby-bonding leave. I was hoping to run
a lot more during this break from work, but it ended up that childrearing and
house projects kept my mileage between 60-70mi/week, albeit with good
consistency in hill repeats and long runs.

The results speak for themselves. Toward the end of the hill training plan in
mid-July, I [ran a standard
route](https://www.strava.com/activities/15154561774) that I’ve run dozens of
times with 1,204ft of elevation in mostly one climb. I felt very sharp, setting
a bunch of uphill segment PRs and not stopping once. Fitness was happening!

Proper marathon training started around mid-August. As the newest edition of
[Pete Pfitzgerald’s *Advanced
Marathoning*](https://us.humankinetics.com/products/advanced-marathoning-4th-edition?srsltid=AfmBOopW26zz3K7IPrEBzqqpWvoIPOY15MierNGlP-00qDIBOhK4UOT6)
had just came out with slightly updated plans, I ended up using a hybrid of the
Pfitz 12/55-70 and 12/70-85 training plans; the former didn’t have quite enough
mileage in most weeks for my taste, so I filled it in with some specs from the
latter plan. My primary goal in training while on leave from work was to be
flexible, but consistent: I wanted to be present for my family and continue to
get house projects done, but I also wanted to adhere to the plan as much as
possible.

I ended up not getting all of the mileage I wanted: only five weeks out of the
twelve were 70 miles or more, but, on the positive side, I hit 80 miles for the
first time ever in one of those weeks, and did so comfortably. All of the other
weeks were in the 60-70mi/week range.

One intentional change I made this cycle that partially accounted for lower
volume was to make my recovery runs *very* easy. Where my target marathon pace
was around 6:35/mi, I made my recovery run pace around 9:00/mi; and where I
often train on hilly courses, I did most of my recovery runs on a flat
treadmill. I think this was a positive change that caused me to feel fresher
for workouts and long runs. Plus, I was able to watch a bunch more of the Tour
de France in July. 

I also largely didn’t do any doubles, instead choosing to focus on finishing
some house improvements.

As the weeks wore on, despite knowing that the key part of the Pfitz plans is
the mid-week “medium” long run of mostly 14-15 miles, I grew concerned that the
Pfitz plans had very little speed work. Still, I stuck to the plan and trusted
the process, reassuring myself that race specificity is likely the best
training and that I still had endurance stamina to build after taking several
months off earlier in the year.

I ran the Boulderthon Half Marathon at the end of September as my tune-up race
and as only my second race of the year.  

{{< img flatirons.jpg "A common view at the start of runs during this build. This will never get old." >}}

With a month to go before the race, I felt great and I was routinely running at
the front of the pack of my club’s weekly long run, which consists of many very
fast marathoners. I decided to postpone the first taper week that Pfitz has in
the plans at three weeks to go and get in one more, final 70-mile week. 

In keeping with the tradition of minor-but-self-inflicted-and-avoidable taper
injuries, I managed to bash my knee cap against the steering tube of [my very
heavy cargo bike](https://urbanarrow.com/family-bikes/family) while performing
a moving dismount that went very wrong. I had to take an additional, unplanned
day off from running, but found that the pain was improving each day and it
even felt *better* when running.

## Pre-Race

I followed essentially the same template as last year.

**Friday evening**: I arrived in New York and walked into my favorite
neighborhood [Michelin Bib
Gourmand-winning](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/tonchin)
ramen restaurant,
[Tonchin](https://www.tonchinus.com/hoursandlocations-midtown). While I much
prefer their spicy tan tan ramen, I stuck to a much race-safer non-spicy
tonkotsu, paired it with some chicken buns and finished with their luxurious
banana pudding dessert to properly kick off my carb load.

{{< img ramen.jpg "Ramen at Tonchin." >}}

**Saturday morning**: 

* I got out the door at around 8:45am to meet up with fellow Boulder Track Club
  members to run up 6th Avenue to Central Park before the [Dash to the Finish
  5k](https://events.nyrr.org/abbott-dash-to-the-finish-line-5k) starts and
  while the street is closed to cars. We watched the pros and elites go by. 

{{< img "abbot-5k.jpg" "The pro women's race flies up an empty Sixth Avenue." >}}

* I visited [my favorite neighborhood bagel
  joint](https://www.zuckersbagels.com/) for breakfast and for provisions for
  the rest of the day’s worth of carb loading. 

{{< img "bagels.jpg" "A man purse full of bagels." >}}

* I went over to the expo to pick up my bib, but left as quickly as possible to
  avoid time on my feet.

**Saturday afternoon**:

* …that said, I went to the [Lego
  Store](https://www.lego.com/en-us/stores/store/5th-avenue) to pick up some
  souvenirs for my daughter, which took significantly longer than expected.

* I ordered delivery from my favorite pancake restaurant in the city, [Clinton
  Street Baking Co](https://www.clintonstreetbaking.com/).

* I watched a lot of running videos on YouTube with my feet up.

* Finally, I ordered pasta from a local Italian restaurant.

## Race Morning

I’m continually in awe of the planning and logistics that goes into moving
60,000+ people onto Staten Island. That said, I got bit by my own assumptions
and poor planning.

Last year, I arrived exactly at 5:30am at Bryant Park and was able to very
quickly get on a bus to get spirited away for a very fine sunrise on Staten
Island. I had hours to wait sitting on the cold, hard pavement of Fort
Wadsworth, followed by 25 minutes in the corral before the race started. The
wait in the small penned-in area prior to walking to the start is unfortunate
because there is really nowhere to warm up.

{{< img coffee.jpg "A much appreciated inspirational message from the barista." >}}

I figured I could leave a little later and save some time. I got coffee at
Starbucks (yuck! but it’s the only coffee place open that early!) at 5:30p and
walked the two blocks over to the library. I found that there was already a
line that snaked completely around the block of the library and immediately
joined it. I don’t know the exact timeline, but this line took forever before
dumping me into what appeared to be the official entrance for the buses, which
was relatively empty. Then, there was a disorderly horde of people getting onto
buses, which had no real organization. Finally on the bus, I fell asleep only
to find that we were stuck on the Verazzano Bridge just before the drop-off
area for an unusually long time. By the time I got off of the bus, the lines at
the metal detectors were the longest I’ve seen them, and as I entered the
queue, workers barricaded the entrance off behind me, signifying that mine was
one of the last buses to arrive.

The security line basically didn’t move. Some volunteers suggested that Wave 1
runners still in the security line should move up. There were a surprising
number of us and we were still many rows away by the time we consolidated
toward the front of the line. I knew the corrals would close at exactly 8:45am
and the closure is very strict. I put my phone in my bag prior to getting
through the metal detector and I took off sprinting toward the blue corrals.

Looking at the map now, I must have taken a wrong turn and then followed signs
for an inefficient route. I did solve my complaint about lack of warm up: I was
definitely running faster than marathon pace for a few minutes before arriving
at the blue section.

{{< img startvillage.png "I got a decent impromptu warmup through the start village." >}}

As I arrived, I saw the blue-bibbed runners walk out of our designated
fenced-in area toward the start line. Between me and them were crowd-control
gates manned by volunteers and security guards.

I ran up to the first corral opening I saw and before I could get any words
out, a volunteer shouted, “The gates are closed! Wave 2 is a perfectly good
wave!” I’m sure it is, but it would definitely impact the first several miles
of my race, turning it into a fun run. That would have been fine, but
disappointing, after having worked for months to try to hit a time goal.

I ran to the next set of gates. I got out a “My bus was late! Can I…” before a
hired Allied security guard said, “The corrals closed ten minutes ago! But come
on, come through here!” and moved aside a gate. “You can’t bring your pre-race
bag through, though.” I tossed my bag at the others surrounding a trash can and
took a step toward the opening. 

But then I realized that my phone was still in the bag! Fuck. I picked my bag
back up and rummaged around and just couldn’t find it. “Come on, man! They’re
leaving already!”, the security guard bellowed. I dumped some stuff out and
finally located it. I ran through the gates, gripped the shoulder of the
security guard, and gave him the most heartfelt thank you I could muster. 

Adrenaline pumping, I hurriedly stripped off my clothing donation, made quick
use of the nearest porta-potty, and moved up toward the start line. 

I looked around and was surrounded by people who had formerly been in the C
Corral, exactly where I was supposed to be.

I owe my entire race to that security guard.

{{< img start.jpg "So many people between me and the start line." >}}

## The Race

Because of the [AbbottWMM MTT Age Group World
Championships](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/rankings/world-championships)
and because of the huge mass of people participating in the [worldwide running
boom](https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/track-field/marathon-interest-boom-races-abbott-majors-world-rcna233298),
I started one coral further back than last year. And, because I wasn’t really
able to move up that far during our walkout, it felt like I started
*significantly* farther back from the start line than in 2024, but the data is
mixed: last year, I was 1678th across the start line and it took me 1m48s to
get there and this year, I was 1506th across the line and I took 2m46s to get
there. 

I had given considerable thought in the preceding days about how fast to go out
for the largely uphill first mile up the Verrazano Bridge. My concerns about
how to pace that mile were entirely unnecessary: the bridge felt significantly
more packed this year and my pace was dictated mostly by very slow runners who
were somehow in front of me, seemingly moving backward in the pack, and also by
people on their phones, either taking pictures or *even texting*. 

Things loosened up on the backside of the bridge, and shortly thereafter I
bumped into my colleague and friend Howon, who recognized me and called out my
name. We chatted for a bit before I tried to move up further.

For the rest of the race, I focused on being intentional about effort level,
trying to maintain a relaxed composure, and pushing myself a little harder than
usual if I was feeling good.

I eventually made contact with and passed by the [2:55
pacers](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/46782088/nyc-marathon-secret-life-pacers),
who started a bit in front of me, in Williamsburg at around mile 11. It turned
out one of the pacers is a friend formerly of Boulder and a member of my track
club. As I was climbing the Queensboro Bridge, I could hear Justin encouraging
and advising his followers. I told myself, “I gotta get away from this guy!"
and put in a little more effort to crest the bridge and start a fast descent
into Manhattan.

{{< img queensboro.jpg "Coming over the Queensboro Bridge with the 2:55 pacers behind me." >}}

{{< img pacer.png "The time gap between me and the 2:55 pacers, who started a few minutes ahead of me." >}}

As is now tradition, I passed [Casey
Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) (creator of two of my
favorite videos about marathoning, [“i got beat up at the NYC Marathon
2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lGLhhoIsNc)” and [“Sisyphus and the
Impossible Dream“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IiTdSnmS7E)) on 1st Avenue
for the second year in a row. I didn’t even notice him on the other side of the
road until seemingly everyone in the crowd in front of me started shouting
“Casey! Casey!” I turned my head and sure enough, there he was.

I had a few niggles during the race. My calves were tight from the line through
about 10km, which is typical for me, and luckily this didn’t result in any loss
of sensation in my feet as in previous marathons. At mile 18 up First Avenue, I
had some novel, acute pain in my right hip joint, which I was worried would
devolve into a race-ending injury, but I ran through it and it abated soon
thereafter.

I felt great passing by what seemed like hundreds of runners on the Fifth
Avenue climb into the park. (The statistics don’t confirm this feeling: I only
passed a net 168 runners over …). Entering into Central Park was a
psychological relief, knowing I was starting the home stretch, but I was
definitely conscious of every step and of trying to maintain good form.

I crossed the line after 2h52m33s of running. I instantly reflected on and was
gracious about the positive effort and the successful training cycle.

And then I looked over to my left to see three dudes puking next to each other.

{{< img floberg.jpg "I also bumped into Eric Floberg after the finish. He published [a touching video about this race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bamn10UTOKk)." >}}

--

I was remarkably consistent across the course, especially considering that the
first mile is uphill and 30km-40km contains most of the elevation of the
course.

| Distance | Split | 5k Time | Difference |

| 5 km | 0:20:43 | 20:43 | |
| 10 km | 0:40:52 | 20:09 | -34s |

Nicholas Thompson in [his new book, The Running
Ground](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678434/the-running-ground-by-nicholas-thompson/),
pointed out that a marathon runner spends about half of the time in the air.
Indeed, I spent 44.7% of the 26.2 mile course *flying*:

\[
\frac{\mbox{2h52m33s running time} - (\frac{\mbox{42.2km race distance}}{\mbox{1.37m stride distance}} * \mbox{193ms ground contact time})}{\mbox{2h52m33s running time}} = \mbox{44.7\% of time in air}
\]

## Post-Race

I’ve made it a tradition to meet up with my friends who are still in the New
York City area after the marathon. This year, I chose [Moody Tongue
Pizza](https://www.moodytongue.com/location/moody-tongue-pizza/), a sister
restaurant to [Moody Tongue](https://www.moodytongue.com/), a
[Michelin-starred](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/moody-tongue)
restaurant in Chicago and brewers of culinary-forward beer. We ended up having
the entire back room to ourselves for a private dining feeling.

We parted ways, but I stopped at [Augurs Well
Bar](https://www.augurswellbar.com/) next door, which has a great beer list,
and hung out with a few groups in the small space that were all celebrating
their own marathoner finishers. I eventually headed back to Central Park to the
Final Finishers ceremony and cheered some of the last runners on toward the
finish line. A stop at [Kati Roll](https://www.thekatirollcompany.com/) on the
way back to my apartment capped off the night.

The next morning, I collected a handful of [Los Tacos No.
1](https://www.lostacos1.com/) breakfast burritos and a mocha latte from [Blue
Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/us/eng?srsltid=AfmBOopBVkURaCKe1YkOpCm-Wgyq5lORBS08ECSGBC0KzMiTXRGJP1aT)
before heading back to Boulder.
