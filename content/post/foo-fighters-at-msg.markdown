Jon, Chris, and I saw the Foo Fighters and Serj Tankian (singer from System of a Down) at MSG tonight. Amazing show. The crowd was not really what I had expected. The three of us *started* the mosh pit. Me. Starting a mosh pit. Ridiculous. But it happened tonight. Many times.

By the end, we (met | had physical contact with) a nice group of guys, and one crazy girl, who felt the same we did.

Sadly, no good concert injuries to speak of. I banged up my knee and elbow a bit, and Chris drew a little blood, but nothing like the guy who broke his leg. By standing there. We had nothing to do with it. Honest.

Sleep.
