From "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/business/30milk.html?">Solution, or Mess? A Milk Jug for a Green Earth</a>":

<blockquote>The redesign of the gallon milk jug, experts say, is an example of the changes likely to play out in the American economy over the next two decades. In an era of soaring global demand and higher costs for energy and materials, virtually every aspect of the economy needs to be re-examined, they say, and many products must be redesigned for greater efficiency.</blockquote>
