From this week's "<a href="http://nymag.com/nymag/strategist/look/archive/">The Look Book</a>" in <a href="http://nymag.com/">New York Magazine</a>:

<blockquote>
<strong>Tell me about your look.</strong>
A lot of it is influenced by Japanese street fashion, but mostly I wear band gear. My favorite band is Glassjaw.

<strong>What are they like?</strong>
It's hard to explain them, but it's music that you want to hear when you break up with the love of your life. Very emotional. Very angry. Honestly, I've never had a love of my life, but if I did, that's what I would listen to when we broke up.

I just look forward to <a href="http://www.punktastic.com/interviews/182">the album from United Nations</a>, the collaboration project between Geoff Rickly (lead singer of Thursday) and Daryl Palumbo (lead singer of Glassjaw, among other bands). Then my life will be complete.
