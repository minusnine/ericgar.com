My mother gave me a cookbook called "The Best 30-Minute Recipe" a while ago in an attempt to get me to learn how to cook. I was just flipping through it when I noticed this entry in the table of contents:

<pre>
    * While The Pasta Cooks
        * Pasta with Greens
            * Spaghetti with Spinach, Bacon, and Toasted Bread Crumbs
            * Spaghetti with Greens, White Beans, Bacon, and Toasted Bread Crumbs
</pre>

Let's be honest: bacon <em>does</em> make vegetables taste better. Meat haters are missing out.

(That said, I &amp;lt;3 vegetables.)
