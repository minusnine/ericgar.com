title: "Braindump NYC - Algorithms"

Tonight was the third meeting of the Braindump NYC meetup physically
hosted by [Hunch] and logistically hosted and sponsored by my friends
at [Hackruiter]. Each meeting has a technical theme and those present
are invited to give very short presentations along the theme.

Tonight's theme was "algorithms" with a wide variety of types being
presented.

The first short talk I gave was on [An Envy Free Cake Division
Protocol][envy], as given by [the paper of the same name][paper]
(PDF) and the fantastic book [Cooking For Geeks][cooking]. I cheated
because a protocol is strictly speaking not an algorithm, but is still
procedural. Nevertheless, the main criticism of the talk was that I
didn't actually bring any cake. I was happy to spread the sheer awe
that I experienced when _I_ found out there is a whole section of
science devoted to optimal ways to cut a cake.

I also gave an abridged short talk on [the Linux O(1) and CFS
scheduling algorithms][schedulers] by Ingo Molnar. The O(1) algorithm
is special for me because its debut during the 2.5 series got me
interested in kernel development for its sheer simplicity and mantra
that working code speaks louder that words.

I'm really excited by this event series. I've learned interesting
practical and theoretical knowledge both times I've went and have
really enjoyed the people who attend.
