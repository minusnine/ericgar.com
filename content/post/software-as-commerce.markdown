"<a href="http://www.digibarn.com/collections/newsletters/homebrew/V2_01/gatesletter.html">Open Letter To Hobbyists</a>" by Bill Gates, 1976:

<blockquote>Almost a year ago, Paul Allen and myself, expecting the hobby market to expand, hired Monte Davidoff and developed Altair BASIC. Though the initial work took only two months, the three of us have spent most of the last year documenting, improving and adding features to BASIC. Now we have 4K, 8K, EXTENDED, ROM and DISK BASIC. The value of the computer time we have used exceeds $40,000.
The feedback we have gotten from the hundreds of people who say they are using BASIC has all been positive. Two surprising things are apparent, however, 1) Most of these "users" never bought BASIC (less than 10% of all Altair owners have bought BASIC), and 2) The amount of royalties we have received from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent on Altair BASIC worth less than $2 an hour.

Why is this? As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

Is this fair? One thing you don't do by stealing software is get back at MITS for some problem you may have had. MITS doesn't make money selling software. The royalty paid to us, the manual, the tape and the overhead make it a break-even operation. One thing you do do is prevent good software from being written. Who can afford to do professional work for nothing? What hobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute for free? The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software. We have written 6800 BASIC, and are writing 8080 APL and 6800 APL, but there is very little incentive to make this software available to hobbyists. Most directly, the thing you do is theft.</blockquote>

From <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a>, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001021.html">today</a>:
<blockquote>I accept that software registration keys are a necessary evil for commercial software, and I resign myself to manually keeping track of them, and keying them in... Furthermore, registration keys are often the user's first experience with our software-- and first impressions matter.</blockquote>

Welcome to the age that thinks software is not the end, but just a means to an end; an end that is something useful to humans: communication, collaboration, creation, perhaps; something more than making someone else pay for something <em>we</em> made for the sole purpose of accomplishing <em>our own</em> goal that costs us zero dollars to give to other people.

Welcome to the age that has advanced itself.

This is disruptive technology. Deal with it.

(P.S. I'm around more often now and starting to contact people.)
