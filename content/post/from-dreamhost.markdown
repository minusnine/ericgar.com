This from a Dreamhost support worker (emphasis mine):



<blockquote>I just ran our <strong>new magical super jabber fixer script</strong>, and it's assured me
that your jabber is working now.  I have full confidence in this script,
but should it have been lieing to me please let me know and I'll see what
more I can do.

Thanks!

I wrote him back asking if he had a version of the script for DB2 or Oracle 10g. He responded:

<blockquote>Maybe now we'll let it loose on our bgp tables... hmm...
maybe best to limit it to jabber.

Cheers!

I love techs with a sense of humor with their customers. It makes working with them so much more fun.
