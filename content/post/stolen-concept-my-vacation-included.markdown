Hearing. No. Experiencing this guy live at Webster Hall:

(Glassjaw..which was a bit ridiculous.  Went with <a href="http://jennifur85.livejournal.com">Jenn</a> who evidently doesn't mind getting crushed by very large, hairy, sweaty men.)

Continuing to hate (but really, love) this guy:

<span><img id="image73" src="http://www.ericgar.com/uploads/2007/01/will-shortz.jpg" alt="will-shortz.jpg" /></span>

(Will Shortz, the editor of the New York Times crossword puzzle). I even watched "<a href="http://www.wordplaythemovie.com/">Wordplay</a>," a documentary on the crossword puzzle culture. Jon Stewart is hilarious.

Getting a new one of these for my car:

(A water pump. I'm not sure if I really needed it, but I like spending lots of money on a car I don't drive).

Staring at this constantly:

(The RSS feed view of Firefox. I've submitted <a href ="http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/?id=2733">a patch</a> to add RSS feeds to Horde IMP (webmail program), along with some other minor ones).

Becoming more geeky:

(Furthering my earmark in "SQL for Smarties" and "Mastering Regular Expressions").

And making one or two calls to Arizona:
