### Horde Project

[Horde][] is an open source project that consists of an application
framework and a smattering of applications in various states of
development. The community is very keen on outside help and it was
fun getting into the project, under the hand of Matt Selsky.

* [IMP][] - a very mature and feature rich webmail client that
is used by small to large organizations. I've been contributing
random bugfixes and small features and getting paid for it.

* <strike>Qonos - a non-Horde core application, Qonos
will be similar to Horde's Kronolith but be more part-time
worker timesheet oriented. This is partially being developed
for another programming team I'm involved with.</strike>
Wrong. This idea was ambitious, but not pursuable for
the timeframe involved. I still hope to make a homebrewed
Horde app.

### Personal

Every now and then I get the urge to work on something that isn't
associated with other external forces. Some people call this
creativity. I call it being a geek.

* Xen on Gentoo - according to the community, it can be done,
but it sure isn't easy. I hope to create some documents and revise
some existing ones that will help other ambitious people use the
[Xen virtualization][] on my favorite Linux distribution, [Gentoo][].
