title: "Dooring Costs"

I got doored by a guy getting out of a livery cab a couple of months ago. The
cab was in the traveling lane, stopped at a stop light.

I was super-lucky: I only had some bruised ribs. Apparently, my front wheel
took the brunt of the force, but I was ejected from my bike and hit the parked
Ford E-Series van with my torso. Nevertheless, [I decided to go to the
ER](https://www.strava.com/activities/1559093686) to make sure I didn't have a
broken rib in danger of puncturing a lung.

In New York, the following laws come into play:

* VTL ยง1214: "No person shall open the door of a motor vehicle on the side
  available to moving  traffic  unless and  until  it  is  reasonably  safe  to
  do so, and can be done without interfering with the movement of other traffic."
* NYCRR ยง4-11-\(c): "Taxis... while engaged in picking up or discharging
  passengers must be within 12 inches of the curb or parallel thereto".
* NYCRR ยง4-12-\(c): " No person shall get out of any vehicle from the side
  facing on the traveled part of the street in such manner as to interfere with
  the right of the operator of an approaching vehicle or a bicycle."

Of course, the driver was not cited with any of these violations by the
responding officer because the NYPD doesn't give a shit about cyclists or
pedestrians.

Here are the costs that have been involved.

My health insurance has a 10% copay on emergency services. I had already met my
deductible for the year prior to the incident.

| **Item** | **Base Price** | **Discounted Price** | **I Pay** |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------- | --------- | 
| FDNY Ambulance Transport    |  $775 |  $775 |  $78 |
| FDNY Ambulance Mileage      |   $11 |   $11 |   $1 |
| ER Doctor              |  $215 |  $201 |  $20 |
| ER "Ancilary Services" | $6604 | $5052 | $505 |
| Radiologist            |   $61 |   $10 |   $1 |
| Radiology - Chest      |   $65 |   $23 |   $2 |
|                        | **$7731** | **$6072** | **$607** |

The "ER Ancilary Services" was broken out by the hospital on a bill to me,
but strangely, the totals don't add up except for the amount I had to pay:

| **Item**    | **Base Price** |
| --------    | -------------- |
| X-RAY       | $549  |
| X-RAY Chest | $489  |
| ER          | $4985 | 
|             | **$6023** |

The ER visit at NYU Langone was pleasant: the doctors, nurses, and radiologists
were all very nice. I had to wait around a while and they eventually forgot to
release me, but otherwise it was fine. It was sad to sit and listen to all of
the people who use the ER as their primary care facility or who are
hypochondriacs.

It took a surprisingly long time to recover, around 4-6 weeks. I likely
aggravated the injury by returning to overhead and bench pressing too soon.
Since I was still a little miffed about cycling in New York, I took up running.

I incurred the following non-medical expenses:

* I had to have a new front wheel built. I went to Sid's who wanted to
  charge me $267, which I negotiated down to $227 after realizing they threw
  out my perfectly good tire. Later, I realized they didn't line the
  rim with rim tape, which I had to do for an additional couple of dollars.
* I decided to buy a front-facing camera, since my GoPro was not
  operational that day.
* A strap on the bag on my front rack got torn off, but the bag has a lifetime
  warranty, so I'm just out some shipping costs.
* The front rack eyelet for my dynamo-powered headlight got damaged and
  eventually fell off. I took the rack off after deciding that using a rack bag
  on a is not advantageous compared to a backpack for my (very narrow)
  use-case, despite enjoying the lack of sweat on my back after commuting.

Things I would do differently:

* Ride even more defensively than I usually do to avoid the accident. I
  definitely should have been travelling at a lower rate of speed and shouldn't
  pass stopped cars on the passenger side.
* Have someone take a picture of the driver's license and insurance
  information.
* File a complaint at the TLC with the video of the dooring.
* Pre-emptively file a claim against the driver's no-fault car insurance, even
  before getting billed.
* Sue someone in small claims court. It would be an educational experience, but
  I'd also have to take time off from work for it.
* Walk myself to an urgent care center instead of taking an ambulance ride to
  an ER, unless I were massively hemorrhaging.
* Not get a wheel built at Sid's.
