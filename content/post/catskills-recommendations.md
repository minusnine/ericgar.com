This is a somewhat outdated list of places in the Catskills I've liked. As of
the time of writing, I last went in November 2020 (memorably witnessing the call
for the 2020 presidental election from our rental house). YMMV.

**[Slide Mountain
Hike](https://www.catskillhiker.net/Catskill35/peaks/slide.shtml)**: The
approach from the west from the Slide Mountain Trailhead Parking Lot) is among
the easiest ways to the top of a 35’er. The view from the top is among the best
in the Catskills. This can be combined for a longer day hike with the summits
of Cornel and Wittenberg Mountains.

**[Phoenicia Diner](https://www.phoeniciadiner.com/)** (Phoenicia): Cute,
classic, kitschy, upscale diner that everyone goes to. Breakfast all day. There
can be a bit of a wait, but just get a coffee from the truck outside.

**[Woodstock Brewing](https://www.drinkwoodstock.com/)** (right next door to
Phoenicia Diner): I’ve never been, but I hear good things.

**[Emerson
Kaleidoscope](https://emersonresort.com/worlds-largest-kaleidoscope/)** (Phoenicia): World's largest kaleidoscope. Enough said. Down the street from
Woodstock Brewing.

**[Town Tinker Tube Rental](https://towntinker.com/)** (Phoenicia): Tubing down
the Esopus River is a fun thing to do on a pleasant day.

**[Garden Cafe](https://www.thegardencafewoodstock.com/)** (vegetarian/vegan)
and **[Oriole 9](https://www.oriole9.com/)** (organic, breakfast and lunch
only) are the most interesting restaurants in Woodstock. **[Bread
Alone](https://www.breadalone.com/)** has some of the best bread in the area.

**[Peace, Love & Cupcakes](https://www.woodstockcupcakes.com/)** (Woodstock) is
worth stopping in for a cupcake.

**[The Little Bear](https://the-little-bear.business.site/)** (Woodstock) is
pretty popular with locals, but I’d say it is just typical American-Chinese
food.

I’ve wanted to go to **[Opus 40](https://opus40.org/)** (outside of Woodstock)
for a while, "6.5-ac. stone-sculpture park in an abandoned quarry with trails &
  a museum featuring vintage tools.”

**[Keegan Ales](https://www.keeganales.com/)** (Kingston) produces one of the
best coffee milk stouts around, Joe Mama’s Milk.

**[Circle W Market](https://www.circlewmarket.com/)** (Pallenville) is a good
place to pick up gourmet sandwiches and provisions before or after a hike.

**[Bear and Fox Provisions](https://www.bearandfoxprovisions.com/home)**
(Tannersville): Best coffee and pastry shop in the area. Instagram-worthy.
