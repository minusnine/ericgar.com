A long time ago, <a href="http://www.ericgar.com/2008/01/07/cythia-lopez-is-a-cool-kid/">I wrote</a>:

<blockquote>I just look forward to the album from United Nations, the collaboration project between Geoff Rickly (lead singer of Thursday) and Daryl Palumbo (lead singer of Glassjaw, among other bands). Then my life will be complete.</blockquote>

Apparently, <a href="http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=160338&amp;">my life will be complete on September 9th.</a>
