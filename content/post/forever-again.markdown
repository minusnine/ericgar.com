> Strong winds and heavy rain pounded parts of the Northeast on
> Saturday, knocking out power to more than 450,000 customers, diverting
> international flights and toppling a boom crane at an Atlantic City
> casino construction site, injuring one police officer...
> 
> The winds downed trees and power lines throughout New Jersey, New York,
> Pennsylvania and Connecticut...
> 
> Logan International Airport in Boston received nine overseas flights
> bound for New York because they no longer had the fuel to wait for
> clearance to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport, said
> Massport spokesman Matthew Brelis...
> 
> In New York, ferry service to Staten Island was suspended Saturday
> night because of heavy winds.
 
In the distant future, someone will read this as if it were written
in the 1800s and read today, and say something like:
 
* "Well, didn't they have personal fusion devices then?"
* "Gosh, why didn't they just transform the weather?"
* "I wonder what happened to the intergalactic flights."
* "Who wants to go to Staten Island anyway?"
