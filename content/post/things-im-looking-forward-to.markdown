* Giving a talk to my colleagues in Asia (via teleconference, sadly) about <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a>, how it works, and why it is super-concentrated awesome.
* Visiting my best friend and his lovely wife in Charlottesville, VA and attending the <a href="http://topofthehopsbeerfest.com/charlottesville/">Top of the Hops</a> beer festival. (Which sadly means I may miss this weekend's <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BugTriage/Summit/Maverick">Ubuntu Kernel Bug Triage Summit</a>. Ah choices and obligations...)
* Giving a talk sometime in the next few months for <a href="http://ny.pm.org">NY.pm</a>'s Perl Seminar group on some facet of <a href="http://moose.perl.org">Moose</a>. All details TBD.
* Posing as a real Linux kernel developer and attending the <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2010/">Linux Plumber's Conference</a> in Boston. I don't feel bad posing because:
   1. I believe that to be good at anything, you need to know as much about the level *above* and *below* the piece of the stack you're most interested in. If you don't have this knowledge, you don't have a good picture on what you're _actually_ doing.
   2. I've spent a good deal of my time, both on the job and off the job, poking around the kernel and drivers to explain emergent behavior or error conditions.
   3. I really want to be a real kernel developer soon.
* Attending the <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/bbf">BeerAdvocate Belgian Beer Fest</a> (which happily is the same week as the LPC and in Boston).
* Trying out the <a href="http://www.whiteyboard.com/">non-permanent, non-furniture-like whiteboard</a> on my wall. I love whiteboards and really love brainstorming with them. There is something less restraining with a whiteboard than dumping my mind onto a piece of paper. It's a serious bummer that the whiteboards at work suck.
