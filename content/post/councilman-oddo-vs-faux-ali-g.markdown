Gothamist reported on a <a href="http://gothamist.com/2007/10/09/video_of_the_da_119.php">New York City councilman irately shouting</a> at what appears to be a Norwegian Ali-G style interview. The video was posted:

I think his response was so right on. He seems to think he disrespected both his mother and his constituents. I happen to think his reaction is just what happens when you screw with a real New Yorker.
