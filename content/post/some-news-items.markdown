Some things around the internet today:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://media.gunaxin.com/the-ten-worst-muppets/37740?loc=interstitialskip"><strong>The Ten Worst Muppets</strong></a> - I honestly don't know all of the Muppets, but as a geek and someone who used to wear sweatervests, I resent that Dr. Bunsen Honeydew is listed as number eight. Dr. Honeydew has inspired generations of once-normal children to aspire to be inventors, engineers, and wear lab coats.

Dr. Honeydew in action:

Amusingly, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's archnemesis, as shown above, lives on in <a href="http://www.dobi.nu/">Rob Dobi</a>'s <a href="http://twitpic.com/odlho">recent acquisition</a>.

Peter King (R-NY) Wants Military Tribunal For Plane Terror Suspect</strong></a> - Ergo <strong>Peter King only ever wants the Constitution applied when <em>he</em> deems it fit and proper</strong>. That clause has never been included in that document, no matter how much posturing politicians wanted it.</li>

Wednesday is <a href="http://thursday.net">Thursday</a> (and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dillingerescapeplan">Dillinger Escape Plan</a>, and <a href="http://www.unitedfuckingnations.com">United Nations</a>(!), and <a href="http://www.glassjaw.net/">Glassjaw</a>(!)). I'm super excited, especially after this post from Thursday:

<blockquote>thursdayband: Thinking up some surprises for the holiday set list! ;-)</blockquote>

I seriously have to finish an entire day of work with this anticipation?
