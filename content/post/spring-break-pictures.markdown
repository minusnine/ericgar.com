I've posted <a href="http://www.ericgar.com/photo/v/springbreak07">spring break pictures</a>. Me and my beautiful girlfriend (giraffe?) traveled to Cozumel and stayed at the <a href="http://www.parkroyalhotels.com.mx/">Park Royal resort</a>.

Some notes:
<ul>
<li>I was impressed by the resort. I thought the service was fantastic. There were so many people working at the resort, cleaning, serving, servicing, and generally attending to guests.</li>
<li>The resort grounds were pristine and just great.</li>
<li>Our room was one of the better rooms I've ever stayed in. The beach was disappointing, being small and rocky, but the rest of the amenities were good.</li>
<li>The food was acceptable, but Emmi correctly points out that it would get monotonous for any more than the five nights we spent there. The two of the three a-la-carte restaurants (included in the all-inclusive package) we went to were slightly strange, the Italian being the better of the two. </li>
<li>There was often strong competition for lounge chairs.</li>
<li>I found it to be the perfect, relaxing, non-binge-drinking vacation.</li>
</ul>
