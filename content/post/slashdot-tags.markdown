Tagging has been a great way for [slashdot][slashdot] readers to
interact with the moderated stories. My two favorites:

[slashdot]: http://slashdot.org

[Yes][yes] and [No][no]

[yes]: http://ask.slashdot.org/tags/yes
[no]: http://ask.slashdot.org/tags/no

I'm really glad those questions were answered for me.
