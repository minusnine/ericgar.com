When work is a big playground (albeit with real consequences of failure), it's hard to get out of the mind set of the enterprise infrastructuralist.

Today I was walking back home and thinking, "My apartment is a single point of failure for some of my critically important data. Hmm. Okay, well, I should replicate it remotely somewhere. But if I were to do that, I might as well have remotely replicated storage as well. So I need some SAN space mirrored at the hardware level between two disparate geographic sites. But then, I need two dedicated servers co-located with that storage to actually serve me the files. Or maybe I should just use snap-mirrored NFS toasters."

Then I came to my senses.

I'm still sad I don't have my own datacenter(s).
