This was <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.moose/2009/10/msg1134.html">a post</a> on the mailing list for the Moose object system for Perl:

<blockquote>
Me on Twitter yesterday: "Had to hack Moose::Meta::Method::throw_error() to make it Carp::confess() to tell how an attribute constraint was being violated. Grrr." and "T'was the attribute builder that did it.".                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
This isn't the first time that I've had to muck with throw_error() to tell what's going on.  Only showing the stack from the caller and up makes debugging harder.

Oh no. Is the Internet going to stoop to using Twitter for bug reports and requests for enhancements? I certainly hope not. 140 characters of gripe an RFE does not make.

At least he didn't have to shorten his posts by removing random vowels.
