I just want to give a public shout out to <a href="http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/">Brookfield Properties</a> for being cool with us geeks bringing our foldable bikes into <a href="http://www.brookfieldproperties.com/building/detail.cfm?BID=69">One New York Plaza</a>.

The midtown offices would probably have none of that

Next wish: provide centralized bike parking. Or at least non-rotating doors that actually open.
