Both members of the on-call rotation are handling escalations well, despite
their shift starting with them having only some theoretical knowledge of what
they were doing. Reverse engineering a production [human] system, employing an
OODA loop, performing under pressure, and quickly filtering and employing
available reference literature have been notably transferable skills.

Our cat, Fiona, is not impressed with her new roommate. (It's been a rough year
for her: we also got a Roomba.)

So far, the steady state of being a parent is like being Admiral Adama in the
[first episode of the most recent Battlestar
Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_(Battlestar_Galactica)#Plot):
handling long lulls that are regularly punctuated with intense periods of
action, including the corresponding sleep deprivation and no clear end in
sight, and with the high-level goal of survival. It's fitting that the episode
ends with the birth of a child and the series has a (mostly) happy ending.
