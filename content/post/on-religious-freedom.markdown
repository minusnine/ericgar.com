> It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was the
> indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise
> of their inherent natural rights. For happily, the government of the
> United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no
> assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection
> should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all
> occasions their effectual support.

- [George Washington on religious freedom, 1790][gw]

> Anyone who trades liberty for security deserves neither liberty nor security.

- attributed to Benjamin Franklin. 

> It's outrageous that Andrew Cuomo is raising the issue of religion
> This is about security; it's about the security and safety of the
> people of New York.

- Rick Lazio, Republican candidate for governor of New York State,
