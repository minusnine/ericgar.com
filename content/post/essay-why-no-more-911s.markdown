<span><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/06/why_is_terroris.html">pointed out</a> a great essay, <a href="http://slate.com/id/2213025">"Why No More 9/11s?" by Timothy Noah on Slate</a>. It's long, but worth the read.</span>

The essay is divided into eight parts that discuss the various
theories as to why there has not been a major terrorist attack on
American soil since 9/11:

1. **The Terrorists-Are-Dumb Theory**: 9/11 was a lucky shot, being a big-time terrorist is hard.
1. **The Near-Enemy Theory**: It's easier to attack the closer enemy (Iraq, Afghanistan) than far (US soil).
1. **The Melting-Pot Theory**: The US has been more successful in assimilating Muslims into society.
1. **The Burden-Of-Success Theory**: It's hard to do better than 9/11, so don't.
1. **The Flypaper Theory**: It's easier to attack Americans in the Middle East than in the US.
1. **The He-Kept-Us-Safe Theory**: Part of why George Bush will be considered the worst president in United States history.
1. **The Electoral-Cycles Theory**: (Non-)Correlation of terrorist attacks with US electoral events.
1. **The Time-Space Theory**: Applying rational-choice theory to terrorism.
