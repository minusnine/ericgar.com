There is a nice little Op-Ed about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/opinion/17osinski.html">the bond that forms between coders and their code</a> and the value of ideas over implementation. 

The most interesting part of it to me, though, was the by-line:

<blockquote>Michael Osinski, a former computer programmer, is an oyster farmer. </blockquote>

Interesting life decision. I'd like to know more about that.
