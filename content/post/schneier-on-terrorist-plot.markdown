<span><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/12/separating_expl.html">The below is from from Schneier</a> on the terrorist plot. Normally I don't lift posts in their entirety, but this one is just logical:</span>

<blockquote>Chechen terrorists did it in 2004. I said this in an interview with then TSA head Kip Hawley in 2007:
    <blockquote>I don't want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers.
</blockquote>

And what sort of magical thinking is behind the rumored TSA rule about keeping passengers seated during the last hour of flight? Do we really think the terrorist won't think of blowing up their improvised explosive devices during the first hour of flight?

For years I've been saying this:

<blockquote>    Only two things have made flying safer [since 9/11]: the reinforcement of cockpit doors, and the fact that passengers know now to resist hijackers.</blockquote>

This week, the second one worked over Detroit. Security succeeded.</blockquote>
