In 2003, I composed the following "Senior Traits" to be placed next to my picture in my senior year high school yearbook.

<ol>
<li><strong>Trademark</strong>: At least three computing devices on me at one time, my noises.</li>
<li><strong>Pet Peeve</strong>: Those who do not signal when turning in a car.</li>
<li><strong>Idol</strong>: Richard P. Feynman</li>
<li><strong>Weakness</strong>: Binary, mathematics and science, a good espresso.</li>
<li><strong>Favorite Saying</strong>: "Polymorphism".</li>
<li><strong>Most Prized Possession</strong>: My palm pilot.</li>
<li><strong>One Wish</strong>: To make a difference in someone's world.</li>
<li><strong>Life Ambition</strong>: To make a lasting scientific advancement after I obtain a Ph.D.</li>
<li><strong>Quote</strong>: "It's perfectly fine to use the name of your pet or child as a password. However, for the sake of security, make sure the names of all your pets and children contain several non-alphanumeric characters" - Lore Sjoberg</li>
</ol>
