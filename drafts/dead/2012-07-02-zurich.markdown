It is a widely accepted rule that communication over videoconference
reduces the apparent IQ of the remote party by 20 points. Because my
team is spread between New York and Zurich, we spend a lot of time
on VC "discussing" the state and future of the system we maintain. We
are fortunate to have a pretty liberal travel policy to try to regain
some of those IQ points; from day one of being on the team, my
management insisted that I go to Zurich as early as possible.

I finally got around to going, six months later.

General comments:

Upon arriving in Zurich, my first observation was that everything
was quiet, orderly, and clean. This is a distiction from, say, the
arrival hall at JFK, the diamond airport of my hometown. In the Zurich
airport, the attention to minimalist, functional details is
impeccable. Even the luggage claim area was as quiet as a library,
which again, is quite a diffence to the lumbering mechanics of
the aluminum plates at JFK.

Transportation:

My first problem was getting out of the airport. With no time pressure,
I decided to take a train into the city. Protip: non-smartcard credit
cards will not work in the train ticket vending machines in the
station. Use a ticket agent instead. Also, the numbers on the side
of the train cars indicate what class of seating is inside. First
class is only moderately nicer than second class, and is only worth
it on a crowded train (which I have yet to experience).
