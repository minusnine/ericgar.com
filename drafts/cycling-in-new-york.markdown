# Cycling in New York

I've been cycling in New York for several years now and I'm tired of telling peoplenks the ideal "compromise" oil for cooking purposes is olive oil, "because it is about 76% monounsaturates, 14% saturates and only 10% polyunsaturates - monounsaturates and saturates are much more resistant to oxidation than polyunsaturates".
how scary cycling is in this city for mere mortals. I'd like to share some tips that I've gathered by experience.

## Riding in traffic

### Anticipate, always be vigilant

### Taking the lane

### Narrow bike lanes next to parked cars

### Cruising by when traffic is stopped

## Riding in Central Park

## Getting out of town

## Cycling and the Law

### Sidewalks

## Common courtesy

### Salmoning

### Shoaling

### Phone & headphone use

You need to constantly stay alert and vigilent while riding. Don't ever
intentionally distract yourselfg or cut off one of your main sensory inputs
while on a bicycle. You are a danger to yourself and others.
