Best bars

Rattle n' Humm
Gingerman
Terroir

The bodegas at 39th and Lex and 39th and 2nd have pretty great six-pack selection

Best Bagel

The best bagel in the neighborhood is at Zucker's. Get the Traditional, #1,
which is how New York bagels should be. The other bagel places in the
neighborhood aren't really worth your time.

Best restaurants

Wild Edibles serves up really good fish and craft beer, but the restaurant itself is cramped and noisy.

Salvation Taco - Good tacos, but hip and expensive. The mixed drinks are hit or miss.

Nirvana - Best very local Indian food for when you don't want to trek down to Curry Hill.

Num Pang - Neighborhood Vietnamese sandwich shop, always delightful. Closes early.

Hummus Kitchen - Great cheap brunch full of veggies.

Penelope's - Great brunch, long wait.

Best Coffee
Zuckers sells ____ beans


Late nights during the week

  - Bareburger??
  - Just Salad??

Late night Sunday

Given that my company doesn't feed me on the weekends, I find
myself in need of food late on Sunday night. Murray Hill is not awesome for
late night options. Most places, if they're open on Sunday evening at all,
close their kitchens at 10pm.

Recommended places that don't are:
  - Rattle n' Hum. Kitchen closes at midnight on Sundays.
  - New Won Jo, decent Korean BBQ place with a good traditional Korean menu,
    open 24 hours.
