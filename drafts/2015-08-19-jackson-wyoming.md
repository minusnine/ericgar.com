# Food

Villa Coffeehouse - There isn't a whole lot of non-chain breakfast options in
Idaho Falls. We chose to visit this coffeehouse before driving two hours to
Jackson because of their extensive breakfast sandwich list. Their food didn't
disappoint: the breakfast burrito was delicious. Stick to drip coffee (first
refill free) over their espresso offerings.

Grand Teton Brewing Company - This brewery is located between Idaho Falls and
Jackson. Their tiny tasting room was a great pitstop. Their beers were great,
the popcorn was hot and fresh, and both the staff and the visitors were
convivial. I heard their home-made root beer on tap was quite good. They have
chairs on the deck which looked lovely, but it was a bit too cold when we
visited to take advantage of them.  They don't serve food, but a food truck
might eventually arrive. Get a few special release bombers to go for the
evenings in Jackson.

Local - Upon arriving in Jackson, we walked around the town center to get our
bearings. We came across Local and decided to have dinner at the bar. As it
turned out, Local was already on our shortlist of restaurants to visit, as T&L
claims they have the #2 burger in the area. We liked the food, the menu, tap
list filled with local brews, cocktail list, and bar service so much we
returned a few nights later. (We did see that food was slow to arrive for some other
patrons, however. Pass the time by having another beer!).

Jackson Farmer's Market - The market surrounds the town square on Saturday
mornings. There are a number of eateries with stands. The breakfast sandwiches
from ------. Both the --- and the --- were only okay, but the optional pickled
toppings gained some acclaim. The wait was also long and they were slightly
disorganized in handling orders. We got *massive* donuts from  __ __ . I like
the plainest of the plain donuts and had the cinnamon twist; it was quite good,
though expectedly too sugary for me. Yuko had the nutella doughnut, which was
filled with a metric ton of hazelnut spread.

Snake River Brewing - The largest local brewery, Snake River was on the top of
my list because it won Small Brewery of the Year twice at the Great American
Beer Festival. The food is fine bar food, but otherwise unremarkable: The
peach/chorizo pizza was worth trying (though the barbecue sauce added even too
much sweetness). The pulled pork was average. The beer, though, was great. I
had both of their IPAs on offer: Olde Gregg, an alternative to their
best-selling Packo's, and the I Do, which was specially brewed for the
brewmaster's own wedding. I wish we had the time to come back just for drinks.

The Handle Bar at the Four Seasons - I had wanted to check out the Four
Seasons' grounds and their beer and whiskey-oriented restaurant was on the way
to the hiking trail we chose. I had completed my bike ride earlier and was
starving, so had the burger, which was excellent, paired with a Deschutes IPA.
It was fun watching the downhill mountain bikers complete their runs from the
outdoor, umbrella-covered patio. The service was impeccable for us, as can be
expected at the Four Seasons. It's worth coming by if you're in the area.

Persephone - This is a cute litle bakery that you must visit at least once.
Persephone ticked most of the boxes I have for a breakfast place: They have
delicious baked goods: I've never seen Yuko fawn over a cinnamon morning roll
before). They take coffee seriously (I was warned that my
macchiato would be made properly, not like most outposts in the midwest;
indeed, it was perfect). Their prepared breakfast foods (mostly egg-based) are
good (but small). The biggest downside is that they only offer counter service,
which was distracting: it requires that you listen for your name and make
several trips around their tiny storefront between lots of people and tables.
If it were warmer out, we would have eaten outside on the deck, which looked
lovely.

Cafe Genevieve - We were in need of lunch and sat down on their patio outside.
The food was only okay (the chorizo tasted like the Ortega taco mix my mom used
to use when I was a kid). The bathroom was disgusting. The location, right off
of the town square, and the seating were great.

Moo's - Yuko is an amateur ice cream critic and gives Moo's a solid 8/10. She
likes the huge variety of flavors (they serve 24 each day out of their
repetoire of 200), the good cones, and the organic and locally-sourced
ingredients. She required that we return another day for a second cone.

Couloir - This was the surprise of our vacation. While we were sitting at the
bottom of the mountain at The Handle Bar, I mentioned to Yuko that there is a
restaurant and bar at the top of the mountain. She found the last reservation
for the following evening at 8:30pm. They serve a four-course prix fixe menu
with many choices for the first three, with a dessert sampler to finish.. To
get there, you have to take a phenomenal ten minute gondola ride, and includes
a glass of cuvee. (In fact, this is how all of their supplies are transported
up to the restaurant as well). The view was fantastic, though the sun was only
up for part of our stay. The food was excellent: we thoroughly enjoyed every
course. The service was on par with the food. The wine list is so extensive
that they have won Wine Spectator awards for their program. The ride back down
via the gondola in the pitch-black darkness was exhillerating. I think the
winning move here is to book at least one night at the Four Seasons, have lunch
at The Handle Bar, get a reservation for that night at Couloir, and enjoy the
wine and beer in the safety of not having to drive through buffalo-filled
roads.

Old Faithful Inn - After driving to Yellowstone in the morning and arriving at
Old Faithful just before an eruption, we had lunch in the namesake restaurant.
The service was good, but the food was slow to arrive. The vegetarian reuben
was surprisingly good. The buffet was surprisingly sad looking. If it were a
bit warmer, I would have preferred to get a sandwich from the adjoining cafe
and sit out on the deck overlooking the geyser.

Lake Lodge Cafeteria - This cafeteria (in the style of a college dining hall)
was along the return leg of our Yellowstone drive. Its primary purpose is to
serve the visitors staying at the adjoining cabins and campgrounds. It was
surprisingly good cafeteria food: I had a Thanksgiving-style turkey dinner that
I wouldn't mind having again. It was likely the best dinner option we had after
a long day of visiting Yellowstone and having to drive back to Jackson.
